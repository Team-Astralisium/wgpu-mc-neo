# wgpu-mc
wgpu-mc is a pure-Rust crate which is designed to be usable by anyone who needs to render
Minecraft-style scenes using Rust. The main user of this crate at this time is the Minecraft mod
Electrum which replaces Minecraft's official renderer with wgpu-mc.
However, anyone is able to use this crate, and the API is designed to be completely independent
of any single project, allowing anyone to use it. It is mostly batteries-included, except for a
few things.

# Considerations

This crate is unstable and subject to change. The basic structure for features such
as terrain rendering and entity rendering are already in-place but could very well change significantly
in the future.

# Setup

wgpu-mc, as you could have probably guessed, uses the [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) crate
for communicating with the GPU. Assuming you aren't running wgpu-mc headless (if you are, I assume
you already know what you're doing), wgpu-mc can handle surface and device setup for you, as long
as you pass in a valid window handle. See [init_wgpu]

# Rendering

wgpu-mc makes use of a trait called `WmPipeline` to describe any struct which is used for
rendering. There are multiple built in pipelines, but they aren't required to use while rendering.

## Terrain Rendering

The first step to begin terrain rendering is to implement [BlockStateProvider](cr).
This is a trait that provides a block state key for a given coordinate.

## Entity Rendering

To render entities, you need an entity model. wgpu-mc makes no assumptions about how entity models are defined,
so it's up to you to provide them to wgpu-mc.

See the [render::entity] module for an example of rendering an example entity.
