//! PIX captures, through the libraries PIX ships.
//!
//! PIX is Microsoft's D3D12 debugger. A *timing capture* records what the title did - GPU work,
//! PIX GPU events, API markers, and optionally CPU samples and callstacks - and PIX reads it back
//! on the machine that took it. It is normally started from the PIX UI, either by launching the
//! game through PIX or by attaching to a running one; a title can also ask for one itself:
//! `PIXBeginCapture(PIX_CAPTURE_TIMING, params)` starts it and `PIXEndCapture` finishes it.
//!
//! Both ways need PIX's own libraries *inside this process*, and they are not the same library:
//!
//!  * `WinPixGpuCapturer.dll` hooks D3D12 so PIX can attach for a GPU capture. It has to be loaded
//!    **before the first D3D12 call** - before the device exists - or PIX refuses to attach with
//!    "this process has not loaded WinPixGpuCapturer.dll", which is a thing that actually happened.
//!    [`load_capturers`] is called from the device creation path for exactly that reason.
//!  * `WinPixTimingCapturer.dll` is what a programmatic timing capture runs through.
//!
//! Neither is part of Windows, and neither is in the WinPixEventRuntime package: they come with
//! PIX, in `C:\Program Files\Microsoft PIX\<version>`, which is where [`pix_dll`] looks for the
//! newest of them - the same search `PIXLoadLatestWinPixGpuCapturerLibrary()` does in `pix3.h`, a
//! header function this is not C++ enough to call. `WinPixEventRuntime.dll` *is* the package's, and
//! is looked for beside the game first; PIX's own `WinPixEventRuntime_OneCore.dll` stands in for it,
//! since its `PIXBeginCapture2` is documented as equivalent.
//!
//! Everything is loaded on demand and every failure says what was missing. Linking against any of it
//! would make the mod fail to load on every machine without PIX installed.
//!
//! Everything here is Windows-only. The capture is a no-op elsewhere.
