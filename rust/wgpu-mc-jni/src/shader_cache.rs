//! The on-disk cache of processed shaders.
//!
//! Translating a pipeline''s GLSL is the work `compile_render_pipeline` does before wgpu ever sees the
//! shader: cyntax preprocesses it, the AST is rewritten - implicit blocks added, combined samplers
//! split, matrices patched, bindings annotated with the numbers the pipeline''s plan assigned - and
//! the result is parsed again by naga to find the uniform block sizes. None of that depends on the
//! GPU, and all of it is deterministic: the same (vertex source, fragment source, defines, binding
//! plan, vertex layout) always produces the same two strings.
//!
//! So the result is kept, rather than recomputed every launch: the key is a hash of those inputs and
//! the entry is the two processed shaders plus everything derived from them that the caller needs -
//! which sampler is a cube sampler, which uniform blocks the shader declared that the pipeline never
//! listed, and the block sizes naga reported. A hit skips the preprocessing, the AST rewriting and
//! the reflection pass; a miss costs one file write.
//!
//! naga''s IR would be a finer grain, but a `naga::Module` has no serialisation - its own WGSL output
//! would be a second translation to maintain - so the processed GLSL is the practical unit.
//!
//! The files live next to the driver''s pipeline cache (`wgpu_pipeline_cache_*.bin`), because they are
//! the same kind of thing: work that belongs to one build of the renderer and can be thrown away.
//! A `version` file holds the format number and the wgpu version; when it does not match, the
//! directory is emptied, so a change to the preprocessing cannot be answered with a stale shader.
