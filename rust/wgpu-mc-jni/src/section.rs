//! The section feed: what the JVM hands over for one rebuild, and what is kept of it.
//!
//! One rebuild of one section needs the 27 sections around it. What the JVM sends is Minecraft's own
//! data, not a copy shaped for this side:
//!
//!  - the block storage **exactly as `SimpleBitStorage` holds it** - its raw longs and the five
//!    numbers that find a value in them (`valuesPerLong`, `mask`, `divideMul`, `divideAdd`,
//!    `divideShift`) - plus a **palette translation table** whose entries are the Rust block keys,
//!    indexed by the *Minecraft* palette index the storage decodes to. Two entries may name the same
//!    key (a waterlogged variant, say), which is what keeps this side from renumbering anything: the
//!    JVM no longer rebuilds a palette and re-packs a storage per rebuild - 4096 `getAll` calls and a
//!    fresh `SimpleBitStorage` every time - it hands over what it already has;
//!  - the two light layers, as raw nibble arrays, but **only for the sections whose light changed**
//!    since the last call - see [`WorldSections`];
//!  - a mask of the sections the JVM believes this side already has, so a cache that has been
//!    trimmed can ask for those again instead of baking against holes.
//!
//! Everything arrives in one call, in one buffer, written by the JVM into reusable native memory -
//! see `RustChunkBake` on that side for the writer and [`Payload::parse`] here for the reader. The
//! buffer belongs to the caller and is reused by the next rebuild, so everything kept here is copied
//! out of it before the call returns.
