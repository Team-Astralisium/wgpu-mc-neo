//! Frame timing from the GPU's own clock, through timestamp queries.
//!
//! Everything else this renderer reports is CPU time. What the GPU actually spent is only visible
//! through timestamp queries: `write_timestamp` records a marker into the command stream, the
//! driver answers with its own tick count, and the difference between two markers - multiplied by
//! `Queue::get_timestamp_period` - is how long the GPU took between them.
//!
//! A frame here is everything one presented frame submits, and the two markers are written into its
//! first and its last submission: the start goes into the fresh encoder the frame's first flush
//! leaves behind, the end into the blit that closes it. Both are on the same queue, so the
//! difference is that frame's GPU work and nothing else.
//!
//! Reading a result back means mapping a buffer the GPU wrote, which is only possible after the
//! submission that produced it has finished. That is why there is a ring of slots and the value of
//! frame *n* is picked up a couple of frames later, whenever the mapping completes - the render
//! thread never waits for the GPU here.
//!
//! Nothing in here runs unless the `gpu timestamps` debug switch is on: with it off, no timestamp
//! is written and no buffer exists.
