            loaded from the newest PIX installation on the machine, before the D3D12 device is \
            created - which is why this needs a restart: a process that loads the GPU capturer \
            after its device exists is one PIX refuses to attach to. With it on, the game can be \
            attached to from PIX (or launched through it), and switching this off and on again \
            while it runs takes a `wgpu-mc-capture-N.wpix` timing capture of 600 frames. That \
            capture records through ETW providers, and only an elevated process may create sessions \
            for them, so the game itself has to run as an administrator - starting `gradlew` from an \
            administrator terminal is not enough, because Gradle reuses a daemon started without \
            elevation and the game, forked by that daemon, inherits its token: run `gradlew --stop` \
            first, or pass `--no-daemon`. Without it the capture is refused with E_ACCESSDENIED, and \
            the log says whether the process was elevated. A capture holds everything the capture \
            API can be asked for: GPU timing, CPU samples with call stacks at 4 kHz, and the memory \
            events - file IO, VirtualAlloc, HeapAlloc, custom allocator and page faults - whose \
            tables (`MemoryEventRanges`, `MemoryPairing`, `PageFaults`, `FileIORange`) are empty \
            without them. That is also what makes a capture big and slow: 1.7 to 2.7 GB for 600 \
            frames rather than a few hundred megabytes, and the frame rate during a capture drops to \
            a few frames per second while those events are recorded. Function names come from a PDB \
            the build writes beside the library (`rust/Cargo.toml` asks for line tables), which PIX \
            reads when it opens the capture - without it every native frame in the capture is an \
            address and its function information stays empty. `GPU resources`/API objects, memory \
            access sampling and kernel image information are options only PIX's own timing-capture \
            dialog has: they are not fields of the API's parameter struct, so a capture with them is \
            one taken from PIX's UI, which is what the loaded GPU capturer makes possible. \
            RivaTuner Statistics Server - MSI Afterburner's on-screen display - hooks D3D12 as well, \
            and with its `RTSSHooks64.dll` in the process the game crashes inside RTSS's own present \
            hook once these libraries are loaded, capture or no capture: the log says so, PIX's \
            libraries are left unloaded in that case, and a `wgpu-pix-with-rtss` file next to the \
            game overrules that. An RTSS profile for the `java.exe` the game runs as, with \
            Application detection level `None`, is what makes the switch work with RTSS installed. \
