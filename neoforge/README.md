# wgpu-mc NeoForge - Neolectrum

This module is the NeoForge port of the Fabric Electrum mod.

## Current Baseline

- Loader: NeoForge 26.1.2.109 (NeoGradle userdev 7.1.21)
- Minecraft: 26.1 (hotfix 2)
- Java: 25
- Mod loader metadata: `META-INF/neoforge.mods.toml`
- Native bridge: reuses `rust/wgpu-mc-jni`

## What Was Migrated For 26.1

Minecraft 26.1 is a large platform break for this mod, because it removed GL-level
control of the render backend. The concrete changes handled here:

### Toolchain

- `net.neoforged.gradle.userdev` 7.1.25 -> 7.1.21, NeoForge `21.1.228` -> `26.1.2.109`
- Java toolchain 21 -> 25 (Minecraft 26.1 moved to Java 25)
- Minecraft 26.1 is **no longer obfuscated**, so Parchment/mappings configuration was dropped
- NeoForge moved to four-part versions (`<minecraft>.<hotfix>.<release>`)
- The module is now actually wired into `settings.gradle`; previously it was not included
  in the build at all and referenced `neoforge_*` properties that did not exist

### Renames applied (26.1 uses official/Yarn-style names)

| 1.21.1 (Mojmap) | 26.1 |
| --- | --- |
| `net.minecraft.resources.ResourceLocation` | `net.minecraft.resources.Identifier` |
| `net.minecraft.client.gui.GuiGraphics` | `net.minecraft.client.gui.GuiGraphicsExtractor` |
| `net.minecraft.util.FastColor.ARGB32` | `net.minecraft.util.ARGB` |
| `net.minecraft.client.renderer.LightTexture` | `net.minecraft.client.renderer.Lightmap` |
| `net.minecraft.client.GraphicsStatus` | `net.minecraft.client.GraphicsPreset` |
| `net.minecraft.client.ParticleStatus` | `net.minecraft.server.level.ParticleStatus` |
| `net.minecraft.client.renderer.entity.ItemRenderer` | removed (use `ItemInHandRenderer`) |
| `SectionRenderDispatcher$RenderSection#origin` | `#renderOrigin` |
| `SectionRenderDispatcher$SectionTaskResult` | `$RenderSection$CompileTask$SectionTaskResult` |
| `PalettedContainer$Configuration` | `net.minecraft.world.level.chunk.Configuration` |
| `PalettedContainer$Strategy` | `PalettedContainerFactory` |
| `LayerLightEngine` | `LayerLightEventListener` + `BlockLightEngine` / `SkyLightEngine` |
| `SkyLightSectionStorage$SkyData` | `SkyLightSectionStorage$SkyDataLayerStorageMap` |
| `RegisterClientReloadListenersEvent` | `AddClientReloadListenersEvent` |

### Behavioural API changes

- `Screen#render` -> `Screen#extractRenderState`, `Screen#renderBackground` -> `#extractBackground`
- `GuiGraphics#drawString` -> `GuiGraphicsExtractor#text` / `#textWithWordWrap`
- `Gui#renderVignette` -> `#extractVignette`
- `DebugScreenOverlay#getSystemInformation` was removed; the F3 lines are now collected in
  `DebugHUDMixin` and the renderer's own line in `DebugEntrySystemSpecsMixin`, which appends it to
  vanilla's system block
- `BlockColors#getColor(...)` -> the `BlockTintSource` pipeline (`getTintSource` + `colorInWorld`)
- Mouse handling now uses `MouseButtonEvent` records instead of `(double, double, int)`
- `Window#window` is private; the GLFW handle is `Window#handle()`
- `Minecraft#resizeDisplay` -> `#resizeGui`
- `GameRenderer#bobView` now takes a `CameraRenderState`
- `VertexConsumer` gained `setColor(int)` and `setLineWidth(float)`
- `AddClientReloadListenersEvent` registers via `addListener(Identifier, listener)`

## The 26.1 render backend

26.1 replaced Blaze3D's GL-level seam with a backend abstraction, so the port now implements it
the same way the Fabric module does.

`dev.birb.wgpu.mixin.core.WgpuBackendSelectionMixin` swaps the `GlBackend` instance that
`Minecraft` builds into its backend list for `WgpuBackend`. From there the whole renderer comes
up on wgpu:

| Blaze3D interface | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| `GpuBackend` | `backend/WgpuBackend.kt` |
| `GpuDeviceBackend` | `backend/WgpuDevice.kt` |
| `CommandEncoderBackend` | `backend/WgpuCommandEncoder.kt` |
| `RenderPassBackend` | `backend/WgpuRenderPass.java` |
| `GpuTexture` / `GpuTextureView` | `backend/WgpuTexture.kt` |
| `GpuBuffer` | `backend/WgpuBuffer.kt` |
| `GpuSampler` | `backend/WgpuSampler.kt` |
| `CompiledRenderPipeline` | `backend/WgpuCompiledRenderPipeline.kt` |

Everything except the render pass is Kotlin. `WgpuRenderPass` stays in Java because
`RenderPassBackend` declares `<T> void drawMultipleIndexed(...)` with an unbounded type parameter,
which Kotlin cannot override; the mixins are Java as well.

### Native bridge

The backend talks to `rust/wgpu-mc-jni` two ways, both addressing the *same* `WmRenderer`:

- **JNI** creates the renderer and returns its pointer.
  `WgpuNative.createWmRendererOnWindow(display, window)` is the entry point the backend uses: the
  window handles are passed in so Rust can create the surface *before* it asks for an adapter, and
  therefore require the adapter to support it. `createWmRenderer()` still exists and creates a
  renderer with no surface.
- **C ABI** (`rust/WmNative.kt`) is the FFI layer for everything after that. The Fabric module
  generates it with the `jextract` Gradle plugin; here it is bound by hand in one file with the
  struct layouts and field offsets written out next to the `bindings.h` declarations they mirror.

Both bridges are checked against the Rust side by `cargo test` - see "Neither compiler checks the
two bridges, so a test does".

### How presenting works in 26.1

26.1 has no `GpuSurfaceBackend` (that arrives in 26.2). `Minecraft` calls
`mainRenderTarget.blitToScreen()`, which routes to `CommandEncoderBackend.presentTexture`. That is
where `WgpuSurface` acquires the swapchain image, blits the colour view into it and presents.
`GpuDeviceBackend.presentFrame` is a no-op safety net, because a wgpu surface cannot be presented
with `glfwSwapBuffers`.

The swapchain format, present mode and alpha mode are negotiated from
`Surface::get_capabilities` rather than assumed. The format is a non-sRGB 8-bit one where the
driver offers it (`Bgra8Unorm`, else `Rgba8Unorm`), because Minecraft's main render target already
holds display-referred colour and an sRGB swapchain would encode it twice. The blit is built for
whatever format won, so the two cannot disagree; it is this backend's own `PresentBlit` rather than
`wgpu::util::TextureBlitter`, because it also has to turn the image over - see "Widget backgrounds
were missing because render targets are the other way up".
`desired_maximum_frame_latency` is 2, which is what DXGI's flip model and Vulkan's default both
expect.

A swapchain that goes stale is recovered in Rust: `acquire_next_texture` reconfigures and retries
once on `Outdated`/`Lost` instead of dropping the frame forever. DX12 reports those after a
monitor change or a fullscreen toggle far more readily than Vulkan does, and the Kotlin side only
reconfigures on a size change, so this cannot be left to the caller.

## Choosing the graphics backend

wgpu renders through one API per `Instance`. Two are wired up: **Vulkan** (the default) and
**DirectX 12**, which is Windows-only. The setting is owned by the native renderer, so both the
options screen and the config file edit the same value.

- **In game**: Video Options -> the **Electrum** tab -> `backend`.
- **On disk**: `config/wgpu-mc-renderer.json` in the game directory:

  ```json
  "backend": { "type": "enum", "selected": 0 }
  ```

  `selected` indexes the variant list in declaration order, so `0` is Vulkan and `1` is
  DirectX 12. `config/fabric/wgpu-mc-renderer.json` is still read if it exists, because that is
  where the config used to live and NeoForge never creates the `fabric/` directory.

The options screen is generated from the schema Rust serialises (`getSettingsStructure`), so the rows
on the Electrum page are exactly the settings the renderer has - `backend`, `vsync`, and the debug
switches under their own heading - and adding one in `settings.rs` is enough to make it appear. The
three placeholder settings the schema used to ship (`test_enum`, `test_float`, `test_int`) are gone,
along with the `TestEnumSetting` enum they needed; a config file that still has them keeps loading,
because every field is `#[serde(default)]` and unknown keys are ignored.

### Which settings need a restart, and which do not

`backend` does, and nothing can change that: the wgpu instance is created for exactly one backend,
and the adapter, device, queue and every texture and buffer below them are built from it - none of
that can be replaced while the game runs. It is declared `needs_restart: true` in
`rust/wgpu-mc-jni/src/settings.rs`, and three things in the UI follow from that flag:

- the setting's tooltip gains a red `* Requires restart` line;
- as soon as a restart-only setting is edited, a red *"Restart Minecraft to apply the marked
  settings"* notice appears above the Apply button, so it is visible without hovering;
- after Apply the notice stays up in the past tense, because otherwise the only signal that the
  restart is still pending would vanish at the moment the change was committed.

Applied settings are written to disk by the Rust side (`sendSettings`), which is what makes the
restart actually pick the new backend up.

**`vsync` does not need one, and no longer asks for it.** It only chooses the swapchain's present
mode, and a surface can be reconfigured whenever the game likes - this backend already does it on
every resize and whenever the swapchain goes stale. `sendSettings` therefore re-resolves the mode
from the settings it has just stored and reconfigures the surface if it changed
(`reapply_present_mode` in `device.rs`); `configure_surface_inner` compares the present mode along
with the size, so reconfiguring at an unchanged size still applies the new one. In a world, a
toggle moves the swapchain between `Fifo` and `Mailbox` with no restart and no dropped frame the
player can see:

```
wgpu-mc: swapchain 2560x1334, Bgra8Unorm, Mailbox, alpha Opaque, …
wgpu-mc: swapchain 2560x1334, Bgra8Unorm, Fifo,    alpha Opaque, …   ← vsync turned on
```

**Minecraft's own VSync option is deliberately inert here, hidden, and kept in step.** On the
OpenGL backend it is `glfwSwapInterval`, whose only equivalent on this side is the present mode -
which the renderer's own setting owns, because that is the one the player sees in the Electrum tab
and the one that applies without a restart. Letting both drive it would mean two owners of one
value: Minecraft calls `GpuDevice#setVsync` from `Window#updateVsync`, which runs at startup
(`Minecraft`'s constructor) and on every fullscreen toggle, so the vanilla toggle would silently
undo the player's choice on the next launch. So:

- `WgpuSurface.setVsync` accepts the call and does nothing with it;
- the vanilla toggle is not in the Video Settings list any more, rather than sitting there changing
  nothing;
- its *value* is still synced from ours - on apply, and once when the device is created - because it
  is not private to this mod. The F3 overlay prints "vsync" from `options.enableVsync()`
  (`DebugEntryFps`), and other mods read it to know whether frames are being synced; a stale value
  there would make both lie. The sync runs on the render thread, at device creation: changing the
  option runs Minecraft's own consumer, which asserts it is on that thread, and a mod-loading
  worker is not.

### Apply sent nothing, because the page was recognised by its label

An edit on the Electrum page is persisted by sending the whole page to the renderer as one JSON
document (`sendSettings`), which is also what applies the settings that can be applied live. Which
page does that used to be decided *inside* `Page.apply()` by comparing the page's name to a literal:

```kotlin
if (name.string == "Electrum") { … sendSettings(…) … }   // before
```

`Page.name` is a `Component`, and once the page labels moved into the language files it resolves to
the text of `wgpu_mc.page.electrum` - which is `Neolectrum`, in every language, and has been since
before the localisation work. The comparison therefore stopped matching, `apply()` fell through to
the branch meant for the vanilla pages, and every row on the page applied itself to a variable that
only the screen can see. Nothing was sent, nothing was written, and the failure was invisible in
both directions:

- no error, because the fall-through branch is a legitimate one for a page without renderer
  settings;
- no *pending* edit left behind either - `Option.apply()` had committed the value on this side, so
  the Apply button turned back into Close and the screen looked like it had saved something.

The next launch then read the old value out of `config/wgpu-mc-renderer.json`, which is exactly what
"the setting does not apply, and restarting puts it back" looks like from the outside. Every setting
on the page was affected, `backend` included - a switch that needs a restart anyway, and so hid the
bug for as long as the page's label happened to be the literal `Electrum`.

A page holds the renderer's settings exactly when one of its rows carries a setting name, and the
renderer is the side that named them, so that is what decides the branch now. It cannot go stale
when a label is renamed or translated. `cargo test` reads `OptionPages.kt` with `include_str!` and
fails if a page is recognised by `name.string` again
(`the_renderer_settings_page_is_not_found_by_its_label`, in `settings.rs`) - the same shape as the
tests that keep the language files and the two native bridges in step, and the only kind of test
this can have: the branch is Kotlin, and the failure was silent rather than loud.

The same launch also says what it loaded, because the renderer's own line about it is dropped: the
config is read during mod construction, and `env_logger` is installed later, by `setPanicHook` - so
`Loaded settings: …` went to a logger that did not exist yet. `WgpuMcModClient` reads the same
document back once the bridge is up:

```
wgpu-mc renderer settings as loaded: {"backend":{"type":"enum","selected":1},"vsync":{…}}
```

### The options are localised, and a missing translation is a test failure

The settings screen is built from the renderer's schema, which names a setting (`vsync`) and
describes it in English. Neither of those is what a player reads. The screen turns the name into the
key `wgpu_mc.option.<name>` - and the description into `wgpu_mc.option.<name>.tooltip` - and looks
both up in `assets/wgpu_mc/lang/`, so the wording lives where a resource pack or a translator can
reach it:

| Key | Text (en_us / zh_cn) |
| --- | --- |
| `wgpu_mc.screen.video_options` | Video Options / 视频设置 |
| `wgpu_mc.page.general`, `.electrum`, `.quality` | General, Electrum, Quality / 常规, Electrum, 画质 |
| `wgpu_mc.button.apply`, `.close`, `.undo` | Apply, Close, Undo / 应用, 关闭, 撤销 |
| `wgpu_mc.section.debug` | Debug / 调试 |
| `wgpu_mc.tooltip.requires_restart` | `* Requires restart` / `* 需要重启` |
| `wgpu_mc.notice.restart_pending`, `.restart_applied` | the two red restart notices |
| `wgpu_mc.option.<setting>` | the setting's name |
| `wgpu_mc.option.<setting>.tooltip` | the setting's description |
| `wgpu_mc.option.backend.vulkan`, `.directx12` | the values of an enum setting |

Two things make this survive a setting being added. The first is that a name no language file has is
still shown as *something*: the screen asks for `translatableWithFallback`, so an untranslated name
falls back to the schema key made readable (`bind_group_cache` as "Bind group cache") and an
untranslated description to the English the renderer sent with it. The second is
`cargo test`: three tests in `settings.rs` pull both language files in with `include_str!` - so
editing one re-runs them - and check that every setting in the schema has a name in `en_us` *and*
`zh_cn`, that every value of an enum setting does, and that neither file defines a key outside this
mod's namespace. Adding a setting without a translation fails the build's tests rather than quietly
shipping a row called `dump_shaders`.

The renderer's own spelling is kept beside the translated one (`Option.setting` next to
`Option.name`), because three places still need it: the JSON sent back to the renderer is a config
file and is keyed by `vsync`, not by `wgpu_mc.option.vsync`; the schema lookup that puts a setting
under its heading uses it; and so does the check that keeps vanilla's own vsync option in step. The
values of an enum setting travel as a key *and* a display name for the same reason: the key is what
a translation is found under, the display name is what a language that has never heard of the
setting - or a language file that is missing the key - falls back to.

en_us carries the names and the screen's wording; the descriptions are the renderer's English and
reach it as fallbacks, so only a language that wants to say something different needs a
`*.tooltip` entry. That is why `zh_cn.json` has all eight of them and `en_us.json` has none.

Vanilla's half of the screen (General and Quality) was already localised - the option names are
vanilla keys such as `options.renderDistance` - with two exceptions that are now fixed:

- the GUI scale row's "Auto" is vanilla's own `options.guiScale.auto` rather than a literal;
- the graphics preset row asked for `options.graphics`, which **26.1 renamed**. The old key is in
  `assets/minecraft/lang/deprecated.json`'s `removed` list, and `DeprecatedTranslationsInfo`
  *strips* removed keys from every language file as it loads them - so the key resolved to nothing
  in every language and the row was drawn labelled with the key itself:

  ```
  视频设置 → 画质:   options.graphics      高品质      ← before
                     预设                  高品质      ← after (`options.graphics.preset`)
  ```

  A key that resolves to nothing is drawn as itself, and there is no compile error on either side
  of the lookup, so the screen names them now: `OptionPages` walks every name, description and
  heading it built once per session, checks each `TranslatableContents` against `I18n.exists`, and
  logs the ones that are missing - skipping any that carry a fallback, since falling back is what
  this mod's own descriptions do on purpose. That line is what found the `options.graphics` bug:

  ```
  wgpu: 1 key(s) the options screen asks for are not in the loaded language, so those rows show
        the key itself: options.graphics
  ```

The F3 overlay's `Render backend:` line is deliberately still English, because vanilla's debug
overlay is English throughout.

### A vanilla option is adjusted through the option, not through a range this side guessed

The General and Quality pages are vanilla options, and three of them could not be adjusted at all.
Each row was a slider over a range written out here by hand, and a range written by hand is a guess
about somebody else's setting:

- `framerateLimit` is stored as `1..26` and shown as `10..260`, so vanilla's slider only ever
  produces multiples of ten. This side offered `5..260` in fives, so a click at the far left asked
  for **5** - and `OptionInstance#set` answered `Illegal option value 5 for 最大帧率` in the log,
  put the option back to its initial value (120) and left the row showing the 5 that had been asked
  for, with the Apply button still lit;
- `simulationDistance` goes to 32 on a machine with the memory for it (the heap size decides), and
  this side capped it at 16;
- `guiScale`'s maximum depends on the size of the window (`ClampingLazyMaxIntRange`), which no
  constant can express.

The option itself knows all of it, so it is asked. `OptionInstance.SliderableValueSet` - where its
slider mapping lives - is package-private in `net.minecraft.client`, so `IntSlider` asks the public
question instead: `validateValue` over `0..1024`, which answers with exactly the values the option
accepts, and the step falls out of them. A click between two accepted values snaps to the nearer one,
so the frame-rate row now offers 10, 20, ... 260 and nothing else.

Applying had a second way to lose a change, and it was the interesting one:

```
wgpu: applied 1 video option(s): 模拟距离=30      ← the row was applied …
wgpu: applied 1 video option(s): 预设=FANCY       ← … and then the preset row was, too
options.txt: simulationDistance:12                 ← GraphicsPreset.FANCY sets it back to 12
```

Editing any individual option is what makes the *graphics preset* row differ from its setting -
every one of those options calls `setGraphicsPresetToCustom` - so "the value differs from the
setting" was true for the preset as well, and the page applied it: `GraphicsPreset.FANCY.apply` sets
a dozen options, the one that had just been edited among them. A row is now applied when the
**player** edited it (`Option.edited`, set by the widgets, cleared by apply and undo) rather than
when its value happens to differ, and every other row is read back afterwards so the screen goes on
showing what the game has.

Two smaller pieces belong with that. `Options#save` is called on apply and on close - which is what
`OptionsSubScreen#removed` does, and nothing here did it, so a change lived in memory until the game
exited *cleanly*; this game is usually killed, and the next launch came back with the old value. And
each apply says what it did, because the alternative is a screen that looks like it saved something
while the log disagrees:

```
wgpu: applied 1 video option(s): 模拟距离=30
```

One thing here is not a bug, so that nobody goes looking for it: `simulationDistance` takes effect
when the world is loaded, not while it is running. The integrated server reads the option once, when
it is constructed (`IntegratedServer`), and vanilla has no live path for it either - the value is
what the *next* load of that world uses.

### Falling back

If the configured backend cannot be created, the other one is tried before giving up, and the log
says so at error level. A backend named in the config but unusable on the machine - a DX12 config
carried over, or a driver with no Vulkan ICD - would otherwise leave the game with no renderer at
all and no way to reach the options screen that would let the player change it back. If neither
backend comes up, `createDevice` throws `BackendCreationException`, which turns into Minecraft's
own "No supported graphics backend was found" screen rather than a crash later on.

To see which backend the *running* renderer ended up on, open the F3 overlay: the `Render backend`
line reports the adapter wgpu selected, which is not necessarily the one that was requested.

### What the F3 overlay says about the graphics card
Vanilla's system block (`DebugEntrySystemSpecs`) asks a `GpuDevice` for a vendor, a renderer name, a
backend name and a version. On the OpenGL backend those four answers are `GL_VENDOR`, `GL_RENDERER`,
"OpenGL" and `GL_VERSION` - the graphics driver naming itself - and the port answered "wgpu" and
"wgpu-mc" for all four, which made the block useless for exactly the kind of report this mod needs.

`WgpuDevice` now answers with the adapter's own `AdapterInfo` (over the `WgpuNative.getAdapterInfo`
JNI call), so the block looks like it does on GL:

| Accessor | Source | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `getVendor()` | the PCI vendor id, named | `NVIDIA` |
| `getRenderer()` | `AdapterInfo#name` | `NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Laptop GPU` |
| `getBackendName()` | the API behind wgpu | `Vulkan`, `DirectX 12` |
| `getVersion()` | `driver` + `driver_info` | `NVIDIA 617.14`, or `32.0.16.1714` on DX12 |

The fourth line joins `driver` and `driver_info` because the two backends fill them in differently:
Vulkan reports the driver's name and version, DX12 puts the version in `driver` and leaves
`driver_info` empty. Either way the F3 overlay names the installed graphics driver, which is the
thing a rendering bug gets reported against.

The wgpu wording did not disappear, it moved: `DebugEntrySystemSpecsMixin` appends
`Render backend: wgpu 29.0.3 (vulkan)` *into the same group*, so it is drawn directly under the
vanilla lines instead of at the bottom of the column. In a full F3 column that block reads:

```
Java: 25.0.3
CPU: 32x Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-14900HX
Display: 854x480 (NVIDIA)
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Laptop GPU
Vulkan NVIDIA 617.14
Render backend: wgpu 29.0.3 (vulkan)
```

which is what `wgpu: F3 system block:` prints in the log when the diagnostics are on - the block
sits below the profiler section and is usually off the bottom of the window, so a screenshot is not
a way to check it.

### Prerequisites and platform notes

- DX12 needs a D3D12-capable adapter and a shader compiler. wgpu uses DXC when `dxcompiler.dll`
  is present and falls back to FXC otherwise, so a missing DXC costs shader model 5.1 features
  rather than the backend.
- Vulkan needs a working ICD. `WGPU_POWER_PREF` overrides the high-performance adapter default,
  which matters on hybrid-graphics laptops where the two backends may enumerate the same GPU
  differently.

## What has actually been run

Everything below was observed by launching `:wgpu-mc-neoforge:runClient`, not inferred:

- The backend mixin applies and `Minecraft` calls `WgpuBackend.createDevice` from its constructor.
- `wgpu_mc_jni.dll` loads, the renderer comes up on Vulkan, and the log line is
  `wgpu-mc backend initialised through wgpu 29.0.3 (vulkan)`. The crash report's `Backend API`
  field reads `wgpu 29`, and the process has `vulkan-1.dll`, `igvk64.dll` and `RTSSVkLayer64.dll`
  mapped in.
- The window is created with `GLFW_NO_API`: `Window` receives the `WgpuBackend` as its
  constructor argument, so `setWindowHints` never asks for a GL context.
- Resource reloading runs to completion, every pipeline the game precompiles is accepted, and the
  renderer draws whole screens and presents them, on **both** Vulkan and DirectX 12: the title
  screen (panorama, logo, splash text, every button with its background, both corner strings), the
  vanilla options screen, and the video options screen on top of a loaded world, which exercises
  the sprite atlases, the blurred background and the GUI item atlas at once. The renderer's own
  dumps were compared against the swapchain image and match byte for byte.
- The in-game HUD and the world it is drawn over come from the same run: terrain, sky and the
  scenery behind the options panel are drawn by this backend.
- Uploaded textures were checked byte for byte against the resource pack's own files: the uploaded
  panorama cubemap faces match `panorama_1.png` with `mad=0.00` and no channel permutation. The
  title screen's sky is blue and its cherry blossoms are pink in the presented frame, not orange and
  purple.
- The F3 overlay's system block names the installed graphics driver (`NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070
  Laptop GPU` over `Vulkan NVIDIA 617.14`, observed on both Vulkan and DirectX 12) with the wgpu
  line under it, and the adapter it reports agrees with the `backend` setting. A run on the DX12
  backend prints, from the mixin that reads vanilla's own group back:

  ```
  Java: 25.0.3
  CPU: 32x Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-14900HX
  Display: 2560x1334 (NVIDIA)
  NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Laptop GPU
  DirectX 12 32.0.16.1714
  Render backend: wgpu 29.0.3 (dx12)
  ```

- A world was created and played: terrain, sky, clouds, the block atlas, the held item and the
  hotbar all drawn, over 5280 presented frames with `acquired=true` on every one of them. The
  window was resized three times before entering the world and maximised to 2560x1334 with the
  world loaded, which is the path that rebuilds a render target and used to end the process.

### Reading a frame without a GPU debugger

When a frame comes out wrong there is nothing to attach a debugger to, and the two halves of the
problem - "the renderer drew nothing" and "the renderer drew something nobody presented" - look
identical from outside the process. `dev.birb.wgpu.backend.Diagnostics` is the switch that makes
the backend answer those questions, and it is a setting now: **Video Options → Electrum → Debug →
Diagnostics**, applied on the next frame.

```powershell
# or, with no launcher support and no trip through the menus
New-Item neoforge/runs/client/wgpu-dump-frames
```

With it on, every `runClient` writes, into `neoforge/runs/client/wgpu-frames/`:

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `frame-<n>-source.raw` | the main colour target at present *n*, turned the right way up |
| `frame-<n>-surface.raw` | the swapchain image that was actually presented |
| `tex-<label>-layer<l>.raw` | a texture right after it was uploaded |
| `atlas-<label>.raw` | a sprite atlas, right after the pass that builds it was submitted |

The frames are 2, 300, 900, 1800, 3000, 4200, 5400, 6600, 7800 and 9000, spread out because the
first ones are the loading splash and a world is only reached a minute or two in. A dump can also be
asked for at any moment, which is what makes "look at the frame I am looking at right now" possible:

```powershell
New-Item neoforge/runs/client/wgpu-dump-now   # dumps the next presented frame, then deletes itself
```

Each file is `u32 width`, `u32 height`, then RGBA8 rows; the
swapchain image is `Bgra8Unorm`, so its bytes are BGRA. A render target is written out turned over,
because that is how the backend holds it - see the clip-space section below - so `frame-<n>-source`
and `frame-<n>-surface` are directly comparable and are byte-identical apart from that swizzle.

An atlas has to be dumped through the pass that builds it rather than through an upload, and only
after the pass has been submitted; the first pass for a label is the one that counts, because that
is the level-0 pass and everything after it is a mip level. A `tex-` dump is the only way to tell a
texture that arrived wrong apart from a shader that samples it wrong: compare it against the
resource pack's own PNG under every channel permutation and flip, and exactly one combination
should come out at `mad=0.00` with the identity permutation among the channels - see "A colour
coming out of a texture is a texture problem". `frame-<n>-source.raw` is flipped row-wise on the
way out, because a render target holds the frame the OpenGL way round.

The same switch turns on the per-pass trace
(`wgpu-mc: pass -> <label>: N draws, clear=..., depth=..., pipelines [...]`), the one-shot
pipeline and render-target descriptions, the present/stats counters, and the line that found the
twenty-gigabyte leak:

```
wgpu-mc: live resources: 767 textures (74 MB), 786 views, 47 buffers (0 MB, 5 quarantined),
         1 encoders, 0 passes, 0 bind groups, 0 builders
```

`-Dwgpu_mc.diagnostics=true` and `WGPU_MC_DIAGNOSTICS=1` do the same thing, but the marker file is
the one that works whatever the launcher does with JVM arguments.

### The debug switches are settings, and the diagnostics cost nothing when they are off
Every diagnostic in this renderer grew as a marker file, which is the right shape for a switch that
has to work without a launcher and the wrong one for a player who wants a single frame dumped. They
are options under **Electrum → Debug** now, separated from the backend and vsync by a blank row,
with `GPU-based validation` at the top:

| Setting | Default | Applies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GPU-based validation | off | next launch - it is an `wgpu::InstanceFlags` bit, and the instance is created once |
| Diagnostics | off | next frame |
| Bind group cache | on | next frame |
| Dynamic offsets | on | next frame |
| Trace dynamic offsets | off | next frame |
| Dump shaders | off | next frame |
| GPU timestamps | off | next frame |
| PIX capture | off | next frame - see "The GPU's own clock, and a PIX capture" |

The section is what made the settings list taller than the window at the GUI scales a small window
allows, so the list scrolls with the wheel now instead of running under the Apply button - which is
also what the General page's last row needed, and it is why a row is only drawn when it fits whole.

The **tooltip is sized and placed the same way**, and for the same reason. It used to be as wide as
the row it belonged to and always started at that row's lower edge, so hovering one of the last rows
put it under the Apply button and off the bottom of the window, with the rest of the description
simply gone - and the descriptions are what the debug switches are documented in. It is now laid out
from its own content (`TooltipWidget`): the width is what the text asks for, capped by the list's
width and by 320 GUI units, the height follows the wrapped text, and it is drawn *below* its row when
there is room for it and *above* it when there is not. What it may cover is the band the rows
themselves live in - `confineTo` is given the top of the button row as its bottom - and the text is
clipped to the box, so a description too tall for that band ends at the box's edge rather than over
the buttons. The one line that never gives way is the red `* Requires restart`, which is drawn at the
box's bottom edge and has the paragraph clipped above it:

```
                                      ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   图形后端   DirectX 12    ← hovered │ wgpu 使用的图形 API。Vulkan 在 Windows 和 …   │
                                      │ … 所以切换要等到下次启动才生效。             │
                                      │ * 需要重启                                   │
                                      └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                    ↑ stops here; 关闭 / 应用 / 撤销 are below and stay visible
```

A row with no description now draws no box at all: `Option.tooltip` is never null - an option without
one carries an empty component - so the vanilla pages used to show an empty rectangle under the row
the mouse was over.

`GPU-based validation` is the one that changed behaviour rather than moving: the instance used to be
created with it unconditionally, so every launch paid for a driver validation layer that only a
renderer being debugged wants. Host-side `VALIDATION` and `DEBUG` stay on always - they are what
makes a wgpu error name the call that caused it.

Each of them is also still a marker file (`wgpu-dump-frames`, `wgpu-no-bind-group-cache`,
`wgpu-no-dynamic-offsets`, `wgpu-trace-dynamic-offsets`, `wgpu-dump-shaders`), and a marker wins
where the two disagree - including the two that are spelled as the *off* switch, where the file
turns the feature off regardless of the setting. The schema says which settings are debug switches
(`"section": "Debug"`), so the options screen draws the heading without knowing what any of them do,
and the Rust side resolves them into atomics when the settings are loaded or applied: the draw path
reads a flag, never a config file or a lock.

That is what made the gating worth doing at all. Three of these were *unconditional* work on the hot
path before:

- `log_pipeline_once` locked a mutex and hashed a name into a `HashSet<String>` on **every pipeline
  bind**. It is one `AtomicBool` on the `BlazePipeline` now, and the name is not read again after
  the first bind reports it;
- `trace_draw` locked the pass trace on **every draw**, to increment a number only a log line reads;
- `trace_pipeline` did the same on every pipeline bind, and the per-pass trace formatted the target
  address on every pass.

All three are behind the diagnostics flag, so a normal run pays one relaxed load per draw for them
- and the counters behind `log_render_stats` are thread-local `Cell<u64>`s rather than process-wide
atomics, aggregated when the stat line is written. `LIVE_*` stays atomic, because those are
decremented by the cleaner thread, and a second recording thread would be a real bug: the counter
block is per thread, so `log_render_stats` logs a warning once if more than one thread ever counts.

The counters read the same whether the switch is on or off, which is the point: they are a cell
increment, not a diagnostic.

### The GPU's own clock, and a PIX capture

Two of the debug switches measure or record the GPU itself rather than the renderer's own work.

**`GPU timestamps`** measures how long each presented frame takes *on the GPU*, which is the one
number no amount of CPU instrumentation can produce. It writes a timestamp at the start of the
frame's first submission and another at the end of its last one - the start goes into the fresh
encoder the frame's first flush leaves behind, the end into the blit that closes the frame - and
reads the pair back a couple of frames later, once the mapping of its readback buffer completes. The
render thread never waits for the GPU: the results arrive through `map_async` when they arrive:

```
wgpu-mc: gpu frame time: 5.22 ms average over 9240 frames (last 4.50 ms, worst 3741.82 ms)
```

The `worst` is a startup frame - the loading screen to a world, where the CPU stalls between two
submissions that a timestamp pair brackets - while the average is what a frame really costs (5.2 ms
of GPU work while the frame rate was around 120, DX12, vsync off). The queries need
`Features::TIMESTAMP_QUERY | TIMESTAMP_QUERY_INSIDE_ENCODERS`; both are requested when the adapter
has them, and with the switch off not a single timestamp is written, so a disabled switch costs
nothing.

The first version of this crashed the game, which is worth writing down: a resolve's destination
offset has to be aligned to `QUERY_RESOLVE_BUFFER_ALIGNMENT`, and the frames' pairs were 16 bytes
apart. wgpu reported *"Resolve buffer offset has to be aligned to QUERY_RESOLVE_BUFFER_ALIGNMENT"*,
and a validation error on the render thread ends the process. Each frame now gets its own 256-byte
slice of the resolve buffer, of which the first 16 bytes are used.

**`PIX capture support`** loads PIX's own libraries into the game, which is what both ways of using
PIX need - attaching to the process *and* taking a programmatic capture:

- `WinPixGpuCapturer.dll`, so PIX can attach at all. It hooks D3D12 as it is loaded, and PIX refuses
  to attach to a process that loads it *after* its device exists: *"the process has not loaded
  WinPixGpuCapturer.dll"* is the message PIX gives, and it is why this switch needs a restart and
  why the load happens before `wgpu::Instance::new`. With it loaded, PIX draws its own HUD over the
  game (`GPU: CaptureTaken 0, Frame Time 8 ms`), which is how a screenshot proves it is live.
- `WinPixTimingCapturer.dll`, which a programmatic timing capture runs through.

For the capture itself the switch calls `PIXBeginCapture(PIX_CAPTURE_TIMING, ...)` - the documented
call, and the reason the parameters struct is written out by hand in `rust/wgpu-mc-jni/src/pix.rs`:
`pix3.h` is not part of any SDK this crate builds against, so the layout is spelled out from
Microsoft's documentation rather than included. Everything is looked for in the newest PIX
installation, and nothing is linked against:

- `WinPixTimingCapturer.dll`, from PIX's own installation (`C:\Program Files\Microsoft PIX\<version>`,
  newest version first); a timing capture needs the capturer *in the process*, which is what
  `PIXLoadLatestWinPixTimingCapturerLibrary()` does in `pix3.h` - a header function, so the search
  is written out here;
- the event runtime, where `PIXBeginCapture` itself lives: `WinPixEventRuntime.dll` beside the game
  or on `PATH` if it is there, otherwise PIX's own `WinPixEventRuntime_OneCore.dll`, whose
  `PIXBeginCapture2` is documented as equivalent.

Nothing is linked against, because most machines have no PIX and a missing import would stop the
mod loading at all. On a machine with PIX installed the log says what it found, and what PIX said:

```
wgpu-mc: PIX: C:\Program Files\Microsoft PIX\2603.25\WinPixGpuCapturer.dll loaded, so PIX can attach for a GPU capture
wgpu-mc: PIX: C:\Program Files\Microsoft PIX\2603.25\WinPixTimingCapturer.dll loaded, so programmatic timing captures can start
wgpu-mc: PIX: using C:\Program Files\Microsoft PIX\2603.25\WinPixEventRuntime_OneCore.dll
[WinPixServices]: Starting
Starting ETW session PixSysMonSession.…
wgpu-mc: PIX refused to start a timing capture (HRESULT 0x80070005). A programmatic timing capture
         needs the game to run elevated (PIX asks for administrator for timing captures), PIX's
         WinPixTimingCapturer.dll loaded in the process, and no capture already running
```

`0x80070005` is `E_ACCESSDENIED`, and it is the one requirement this side cannot satisfy for you:
PIX's documentation asks for the game to run **as Administrator** for a programmatic timing capture,
because the capture records through ETW providers and creating those sessions is refused without it.

**Starting `gradlew` from an administrator terminal does not make the game elevated.** Gradle reuses
a daemon that is already running, elevation is not part of the criteria it picks one by, and the game
is *forked by the daemon* - so it inherits the daemon's token. A run that looked like this, on the
machine this was written on, is what "I ran it as administrator and it still refuses" looks like:

```
pid 136512  java.exe  not elevated   GradleDaemon 9.4.1          started 10:49
pid 122192  java.exe  ELEVATED       (the elevated terminal's Gradle client)
pid 135472  java.exe  not elevated   parent = 136512   ← the game
```

The elevated client asked the *unelevated* daemon for the build, and the daemon forked the game. Both
of these fix it:

- `gradlew --stop` first, then `gradlew runClient` from the administrator terminal, so a new - and
  elevated - daemon is started; or
- `gradlew --no-daemon runClient`, which runs the build in a JVM forked by the elevated client.

The mod now answers the question itself, because the HRESULT alone cannot: `GetTokenInformation`
(`TokenElevation`) is asked once, the answer is part of the refusal message, and an unelevated launch
with the switch on says so before a capture is ever attempted:

```
wgpu-mc: PIX: this process is not running elevated, so the timing capture the `pix capture` switch
         takes will be refused … so run `gradlew --stop` first, or pass `--no-daemon`.
wgpu-mc: PIX refused to start a timing capture (HRESULT 0x80070005, E_ACCESSDENIED). This process is
         NOT elevated, and a timing capture needs administrator: …
```

Everything else in the sequence works without elevation: PIX's service starts, the ETW session is
attempted, and PIX can attach to the process for a GPU capture - the switch buys that on an
unelevated run too. What it cannot buy there is the programmatic timing capture. On success the log
reads:

```
wgpu-mc: PIX timing capture started, written to ...\wgpu-mc-capture-1.wpix
wgpu-mc: PIX timing capture stopped
wgpu-mc: PIX timing capture reached its 600 frames and stopped
```

The lines about the capturers are printed from the **first frame** rather than where they happen:
the loading is part of creating the device, and this crate's logger is only installed by the JVM
afterwards, so a line logged there would never be seen.

Two things about the call itself are worth knowing. It runs on a **thread of its own**: PIX's runtime
sets up COM as it loads, and from the render thread - whose apartment is already set - every call
answered `RPC_E_CHANGED_MODE` (0x80010106); a fresh thread has no apartment yet. And a capture is
**bounded to 600 frames** (about ten seconds), because a programmatic capture runs until it is
stopped and fills tooling memory measured in gigabytes; turning the switch back on takes the next
capture into the next numbered file. The begin/end pairing, the wide-string file name,
`flags=0x1` (the `PIX_CAPTURE_TIMING` bit) and `discard=0` were all checked against a stand-in
runtime that writes down what it was asked to do.

A capture is not only the GPU's clock. Every switch the capture API has is on:

| What it records | `TimingCaptureParameters` field | Table it fills in the capture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GPU work and PIX GPU events | `CaptureGpuTiming` | `ApiQueueExecution`, `GpuApiMarkerRange`, `GpuWorkRange` |
| CPU samples, 4 kHz | `CaptureCpuSamples`, `CpuSamplesPerSecond` | `CpuSample` |
| Call stacks | `CaptureCallstacks` | `StackEvents`, `Stacks`, `ContextSwitchRange` |
| Win32 and DirectStorage file IO | `CaptureFileIO` | `FileIORange`, `FileInfo` |
| VirtualAlloc/VirtualFree | `CaptureVirtualAllocEvents` | `MemoryEventRanges`, `MemoryPairing` |
| HeapAlloc/HeapFree | `CaptureHeapAllocEvents` | `MemoryEventRanges`, `MemoryPairing` |
| Custom allocator events | `CapturePixMemEvents` | (nothing here: the renderer does not use PIX's allocator) |
| Page faults | `CapturePageFaultEvents` | `PageFaults` |

The first three were on from the start; the rest are what turned a capture with **no memory data at
all** into one with it. That is measurable rather than a claim - a `.wpix` is a **SQLite database**,
so its tables can simply be counted:

```
$ node -e 'const {DatabaseSync}=require("node:sqlite");const db=new DatabaseSync(process.argv[1],{readOnly:true});for(const t of ["MemoryEventRanges","MemoryPairing","PageFaults","FileIORange","ApiObjects","SymbolStrings"])console.log(t,db.prepare(`select count(*) n from "${t}"`).get().n)' runs/client/wgpu-mc-capture-1.wpix

                     capture-1               capture-2
                     (in a world,            (at the title screen,
                      memory events off)      memory events on)
MemoryEventRanges         0                     5397
MemoryPairing             0                   413569
PageFaults                0                   673866
FileIORange               0                      252
ApiObjects                0                        0      ← not an API option: see below
SymbolStrings             0                        0      ← needs a PDB: see below
```

The two captures are not the same scene - the first was taken in a world, the second during loading -
so the comparison says nothing about, say, `CpuSample`; it is about the tables that were empty
because nothing had asked for them, and the second capture is the quieter scene of the two.

`MemoryUsageSamples` itself stays empty in the file the game writes: it is *derived* by PIX from
those memory events (`MoveMemoryUsageSamples` in `pixstorage.dll`) when the capture is opened.

**Three of the things an instrumented capture can show are not reachable programmatically.** PIX's
timing-capture dialog has more options than its own capture API: `GPU resources` (the `ApiObjects`
tables - D3D12 resources, heaps, pipeline states, residency, demoted allocations), `Memory Access
Sampling`, `Kernel image information`, `Callstacks for non-title processes`, `Generate .etl file`,
`CLR data`. The names live in `Microsoft.PIX.UI.dll` and in no runtime, and `PixCaptureParameters`
has no field for any of them - it was checked field by field against
`Include/WinPixEventRuntime/pix3.h` from the newest WinPixEventRuntime Microsoft publishes
(1.0.240308001) and against Microsoft's GDK reference for the same struct. `pixtool
take-new-timing-capture` offers the same subset as the API, and `pixtool open-capture` refuses a
timing capture outright ("not a Windows GPU capture"). So a capture with those in it is one taken
from PIX's UI - which is exactly what the switch's installed `WinPixGpuCapturer.dll` makes possible.

**Function names need a PDB, and a release build had none.** The capture's `FunctionInformation`,
`SymbolStrings`, `ModuleSymbols`, `SourceFile` and `SourceLine` tables are filled when PIX resolves
symbols, and there was nothing to resolve: `cargo build --release` wrote a PDB with no source files
in it (6 MB, not one `.rs` name in it), so every native frame was an address. Three changes:

- `rust/Cargo.toml` asks for `debug = "line-tables-only"` in the release profile - line tables, no
  locals, nothing added to the code at runtime, and the PDB grows to ~47 MB;
- `copyNatives` copies that PDB into the mod's resources, and `WgpuNative` extracts it next to the
  library it extracts (`<run>/lib/wgpu_mc_jni.pdb`), because a debugger looks for symbols *beside the
  module* rather than in the mod's jar; the jar itself excludes `**/*.pdb`, since nobody profiles a
  packaged build;
- PIX still needs a symbol path for everything else (the JDK's `java.exe`, the driver, Windows):
  *Configure PIX → Debug symbols*, or `_NT_SYMBOL_PATH=srv*C:\symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols`.

Two things about the API itself came out of this and are worth writing down, because both produced a
wrong answer first:

- **`SUCCEEDED`, not `S_FALSE`.** `pix3.h` documents `S_FALSE` from `PIXBeginCapture`, and that is
  what older PIX returned; PIX 2603 returns plain `S_OK`. The code tested for `S_FALSE` alone, so a
  capture that *had* started was logged as `PIX refused … (HRESULT 0x00000000)` and left running -
  the frame counter that was supposed to stop it had already handed over. Both calls now ask the
  question the header's `SUCCEEDED(hr)` macro asks, which is a sign test.
- **Stopping a capture is not a flag flip.** `PIXEndCapture` writes the capture out, and with the
  memory events on that is gigabytes: it took longer than the ten seconds the call used to wait for,
  and the timeout left the capture running. It now runs on its own thread and is not waited for; a
  capture ends by itself at 600 frames either way, and the log says which of the two happened.

The cost is real and worth knowing before turning the switch on to profile frame times: 600 frames
of a world is now **1.7-2.7 GB** instead of 265 MB, the frame rate during a capture drops to a few
frames per second (the events are recorded synchronously), and PIX itself drops events it cannot keep
up with (`DroppedData` in the capture: 67k-240k rows). That is why the switch is off by default and
why `CAPTURE_FRAMES` is a constant rather than a setting - 600 frames of *play* is what a timing
capture is for, and a capture taken at three frames per second says more about the capture than about
the renderer.

### RTSS and PIX both hook D3D12, and together they crash the game

MSI Afterburner's on-screen display is RivaTuner Statistics Server, which works by injecting
`RTSSHooks64.dll` into the game and detouring `IDXGISwapChain::Present`, `ExecuteCommandLists` and
friends. PIX's `WinPixGpuCapturer.dll` hooks the same runtime. With both in the process, the game has
been taken down with the render thread inside the present path:

```
#  EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (0xc0000005) at pc=…, tid=110920
# Problematic frame:
# C  [D3D12Core.dll+0x11fd5]
Native frames: (J=a compiled Java code, …)
C  [D3D12Core.dll+0x11fd5]
C  [D3D12Core.dll+0x112bd]
C  [RTSSHooks64.dll+0x71a86]          ← the fault is reached through RTSS's hook
C  [d3d11.dll+0x495d2]
C  [RTSSHooks64.dll+0x4beee]
C  [wgpu_mc_jni.dll+0x5a3dbb]
J  dev.birb.wgpu.backend.WgpuSurface.blitAndPresent(…)     ← our present
```

`siginfo: … reading address 0x0000000000000733` is a pointer that is not an object at all, and the
module list of that same crash holds both hook libraries at once - `RTSSHooks64.dll` from
`C:\Program Files (x86)\RivaTuner Statistics Server` and `WinPixGpuCapturer.dll`,
`WinPixTimingCapturer.dll`, `PixStorage.dll` and `WinPixSysMonController.dll` from PIX. RTSS's own
`Profiles\Config` says how it does the D3D12 half: it caches the *private offsets* of
`IDXGISwapChain1::m_pCommandQueue` and of `ID3D12CommandQueue::ExecuteCommandLists` per Windows
version, and drives the overlay through them. A capturer that wraps the D3D12 objects is exactly what
those cached offsets do not survive.

None of that is this mod's code and none of it can be fixed from here, so what this side does is
refuse to load the capturer when the hook module is in its own process. A warning would leave a game
that dies a second after the first frame to be diagnosed by whoever hits it; the switch instead does
nothing, and says why:

```
wgpu-mc: PIX: RTSSHooks64.dll is loaded into this process, so RivaTuner Statistics Server - MSI
         Afterburner's on-screen display - is already hooking D3D12. PIX hooks the same runtime, and
         the two hook chains crash this game inside RTSS's present hook … whether or not a capture is
         running. PIX's libraries are therefore NOT loaded this launch and the `pix capture` switch
         does nothing. Add the `java.exe` this game runs as to RTSS's profile list and set its
         Application detection level to None, or quit RTSS/Afterburner, then start the game again.
         To load PIX anyway … create a file named `wgpu-pix-with-rtss` next to the game.
```

The exclusion is per application, so the OSD can stay on everywhere else: in RTSS, add the
`java.exe` the game runs as (`…\GraalVM\JDKs\25.1\bin\java.exe` in a dev run) and set its
*Application detection level* to **None**. Closing RTSS and Afterburner does the same thing more
bluntly. The `wgpu-pix-with-rtss` marker is the way back if a later RTSS or PIX makes the two
coexist: it is the same shape as every other override in this renderer, a file rather than a rebuild.
A crash during a capture also leaves PIX's own spool files beside the capture
(`wgpu-mc-capture-N.wpix-wal`, `.wpix-shm`, hundreds of megabytes); they are safe to delete, and the
`.wpix` next to them is what PIX can open.

### A shader may declare more than its pipeline provides

Five pipelines were failing to compile because a shader declared something the pipeline's own
description did not mention. On the GL side that is legal and the game relies on it:

- `GlProgram::setupUniforms` enumerates the uniform **blocks the shader declares** with
  `glGetActiveUniformBlockName` and gives `Projection`, `Lighting`, `Fog` and `Globals` a binding
  of their own, so `RenderSystem.bindDefaultUniforms` finds them even when the pipeline never asked
  for them. `core/terrain` imports `globals.glsl` and reads `CameraBlockPos`, while
  `TERRAIN_SNIPPET` only lists `Projection` and `ChunkSection`.
- Attribute locations are bound from the pipeline's vertex format, and an attribute with no binding
  reads the default generic value. `core/rendertype_crumbling.vsh` declares `in vec3 Normal` while
  `CRUMBLING` draws with `DefaultVertexFormat.BLOCK`, which has no Normal - and the shader never
  reads it.

wgpu has neither behaviour, so the Rust preprocessing shim now reproduces the observable result:

- `add_implicit_uniforms` walks the blocks the shaders declare and gives the ones the pipeline left
  out a binding, appended after everything it did declare. `with_implicit_uniforms` appends matching
  entries to the pipeline's own descriptor, which is what puts them in the pipeline layout *and* in
  every bind group built from it, so `bindDefaultUniforms` fills them by name.
- `drop_unprovided_inputs` removes an `in` declaration nothing will provide, before locations are
  numbered. Leaving it in place is what produced `Multiple bindings at location 0 are present`.
- Both were `.expect`s that aborted the process. What is left of that - a uniform or a shimmed
  sampler the pipeline cannot bind at all - now logs and gets a binding that cannot collide, so the
  shader still compiles and wgpu reports the unmatched binding by number.

### NeoForge's early loading window has to be off

`ClientModLoader.finish` ticks FML's early loading screen, and that renders through OpenGL **from
Minecraft's render thread**:

```
FATAL ERROR in native method: No context is current or a function that is not available in the
current context was called. The JVM will abort execution.
    at org.lwjgl.opengl.GL11C.glIsEnabled(Native Method)
    at net.neoforged.fml.earlydisplay.render.GlState.readFromOpenGL(GlState.java:129)
```

That only works in vanilla because Blaze3D's GL backend made a GL context current on that thread.
This mod deliberately does not, so the first GL call aborts the JVM. Whether the early window
exists is decided by FML before any mod loads, so the mod cannot turn it off itself; the only lever
is `earlyWindowControl` in `config/fml.toml`, which the `configureEarlyWindow` Gradle task now
writes before every `runClient`. With it off the log says
`ImmediateWindowProvider not loading because splash screen is disabled` and startup goes through.
**Anyone running this mod needs the same setting**, and loses the early loading screen with it.

### Getting past the constructor took three fixes

All three were latent bugs that had never been reached, because the mod used to die while the mod
list was still being constructed:

1. **`WgpuNative`'s own initialisation order.** The object loads the native library from an `init`
   block declared above `NATIVE_RESOURCE_ROOTS`, and Kotlin runs an object's initializers in
   declaration order, so the resource-root list was still `null` when the loader searched it. The
   list is now a file-level declaration, where the ordering cannot be got wrong.
2. **`loadWm` called two JNI functions that do not exist.** `CoreLib.init()` asked Rust to install
   LWJGL's allocator, but that shim is commented out in `rust/wgpu-mc-jni/src/alloc.rs`, and
   `setClassLoader` has no Rust counterpart at all. `UnsatisfiedLinkError` is an `Error`, so the
   `catch (e: Exception)` around the call did not see it and the game died in `Minecraft`'s
   constructor. `loadWm` now only loads the library, exactly like the Fabric module's
   `WgpuNative.loadWm`, and `CoreLib` is gone. **Anything added there needs a matching `#[jni_fn]`
   on the Rust side, or the first touch of `WgpuNative` kills the game.**
3. **`DebugHUDMixin` contributed a public static method to its target.** Mixin rejects that
   outright. The lines it collected were never rendered anyway, because 26.1 builds the F3 line
   list as a local and passes it to the private `extractLines`. The mixin now appends to that list
   through `@ModifyArg`, which is both legal and makes the diagnostics actually appear.

### Why the game rendered black, and then pink

The last two things between "the renderer comes up" and "the game is playable" were both state
translations that looked right and were not, and both were found by dumping the renderer's own
output rather than by reading code.

1. **A render pass with no clear value cleared anyway.** `BlazeAttachmentDescriptor::clear_value`
   is null when Minecraft asks for no clear - that is `OptionalInt.empty()` - and OpenGL loads the
   attachment in that case. The port used `wgpu::Operations::default()` for it, and wgpu's
   `Default` for `Operations` is `LoadOp::Clear(V::default())`, i.e. *clear to transparent black*.
   Every pass without an explicit clear therefore wiped the target first, which is why the title
   screen presented as its bare panorama: the panorama pass ran last and erased the GUI pass before
   it. It is now `LoadOp::Load`, and the depth attachment honours the clear value it is given
   instead of always loading (`clearDepth` used to be dropped on the floor).
2. **`NativeImage` pixels were uploaded big-endian.** `NativeImage#pixels` packs a pixel per int as
   **ABGR**; the four bytes of an `Rgba8Unorm` texel are R, G, B, A, which is that int written
   *little*-endian. `ByteBuffer` is big-endian unless told otherwise, so every texture arrived as
   `(A, B, G, R)`: alpha in red, green and blue swapped. That is the washed-out pink the whole game
   was drawn in - red pinned at 255 everywhere, because the alpha channel is 255 nearly everywhere.
   One `.order(ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN)` fixes every texture in the game at once.
3. **"No depth state" was turned into a depth test.** A pipeline whose `depthStencilState` is null
   means the depth test is off, which is how every GUI pipeline is declared - the title screen, the
   HUD, the debug overlay. The port filled that in with `LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL` *and* depth writes on,
   so the GUI was depth-tested against whatever the panorama had just written and lost. wgpu will
   not accept a pipeline with no depth-stencil state in a pass that has a depth attachment, so "off"
   is now spelt `Always` with writes disabled, which is the same thing.

The bytes and the depth state are also why the two symptoms looked unrelated: the pink was in the
textures, the missing GUI was in the pipeline state.

### A colour coming out of a texture is a texture problem

The dump above is what settled it, twice.

**First round: alpha in red.** `tex-minecraft-textures-gui-title-background-panorama-layer0.raw` held
the panorama's face 1 rotated by 180°, with `r` equal to the source's alpha and `g`/`b` swapped -
which is a *channel permutation*, not a shading bug, and no amount of looking at blends, uniforms or
projections would have found it. Matching the dumped bytes against the PNG's own pixels (24
candidate permutations x two flips) reported `mad=0.00` for exactly one of them, and that is what
named the bug: the upload wrote the image's pixel ints big-endian, so an `(R, G, B, A)` texel came
out `(A, B, G, R)`.

**Second round: red and blue swapped.** The fix for the first round - write those ints
little-endian - was still one channel pair off, and it put the sky in orange with the blue GUI
icons in red. The trap is that 26.1 has two pixel representations and they are one conversion apart:

- `NativeImage` stores **ABGR** ints and `GlCommandEncoder` uploads the image's own buffer, so
  `glTexSubImage2D(GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, pointer)` reads an ABGR int's little-endian bytes,
  which are `R, G, B, A` - the layout an `Rgba8Unorm` texel wants;
- `NativeImage#getPixels()` is **not** that buffer. It copies and converts every element through
  `ARGB.fromABGR`, so it hands back ARGB, and an ARGB int's little-endian bytes are `B, G, R, A`.

The upload used `getPixels()` and then trusted the endianness, which is what swapped red and blue.
It now takes the four channels apart explicitly (`R` is bits 16-23, `G` 8-15, `B` 0-7, `A` 24-31)
and writes them in order, so no int representation can be mistaken for the byte layout again. The
same measurement confirms it: the uploaded face against `panorama_1.png` reports
`perm=0123 flipY mad=0.00` - the identity permutation - where it used to report `perm=2103`. The
`flipY` is the cube face's own orientation and not a colour matter, and the same file also explains
why this reached everything: every block, item, GUI, font and panorama texture in the game is
uploaded through that one call.

The other upload entry point, the `ByteBuffer` overload, is passed through unchanged and that is
correct: `UnihexProvider` is its only caller in 26.1, it fills the buffer with `0xFFFFFFFF` and `0`
(white and transparent, where no channel order can go wrong), and OpenGL reads the very same four
bytes per texel as `GL_RGBA`.

### Widget backgrounds were missing because render targets are the other way up

The title screen drew its logo, its splash text, every button *label* and both corner strings - and
no button backgrounds at all. The labels and the logo come from textures that were uploaded, so the
one thing they have in common is what the missing part is not: the backgrounds come from
`minecraft:widget/button`, a sprite in `minecraft:textures/atlas/gui.png`, and that atlas is not
uploaded. 26.1 *renders* it: `TextureAtlas#uploadInitialContents` draws every static sprite through
`animate_sprite_blit` into `mipViews[level]`, one pass per mip level, and the GUI later samples the
result with `u = x / width, v = y / height`.

That works on OpenGL and not here, because OpenGL and every other API disagree about which end of a
render target clip-space `y = +1` is. In OpenGL a framebuffer's first texel row is its window origin
row - the bottom-left corner - so `y = +1`, the top of the projection, lands on the *last* texel row.
Vulkan, D3D and Metal all put it on the *first*, and wgpu normalises them, so the sprite quads were
drawn into the atlas mirrored. Minecraft then sampled the rectangle it had packed the sprite into and
found empty atlas, which draws nothing at all.

Nothing notices while the target is only presented - the picture comes out the same either way up -
and that is why this survived the earlier rounds. It shows the moment a render target is *sampled
with Minecraft's own texture coordinates*, and in 26.1 that is every sprite atlas, the GUI item
atlas and the picture-in-picture renderers.

The fix is one statement appended to `main` in every translated vertex shader
(`preprocessing::EmulateGlClipSpace`), on top of the depth-range patch that was already there:

```glsl
gl_Position.y = -gl_Position.y;
```

That is what a translation layer does for the same reason, and it needs one compensation: the
present blit now turns the image over on its way to the swapchain (`PresentBlit` in `device.rs`,
replacing `wgpu::util::TextureBlitter`). It also puts `gl_FrontFacing` back the way Minecraft
expects it, because front-facing is counter-clockwise in *window* coordinates in OpenGL and
counter-clockwise in *framebuffer* coordinates here, and mirroring the clip space is what
reconciles the two.

Three things were wrong around the same area and were found while looking for it:

1. **A texture's mip chain was created with one level.** `create_texture` hardcoded
   `mip_level_count: 1` and ignored the count Minecraft asked for, so `blocks.png` (2048x2048, five
   levels) had nowhere to put levels 1-4.
2. **A texture view ignored the mip range it was asked for.** `base_mip_level` was 0 and
   `mip_level_count` was "the rest" for every view. wgpu only accepts a view with *exactly one* mip
   level as a render attachment, and the level a view starts at is the size the pass renders at, so
   the five `Animate blocks.png` passes all rendered into mip 0 - each one a shrunken copy of the
   whole atlas, on top of the last.
3. **`write_to_texture` dropped every upload with `mip_level != 0`.** That was a guard against
   levels that did not exist, and with (1) fixed it is a bounds check instead: Minecraft uploads a
   sprite's whole chain one level at a time, and a 9x9 sprite in a five-level atlas legitimately has
   fewer levels than the atlas does.

**How it was found**, because none of this is visible in a log: with the frame dump on, the GUI
atlas is written out too (`atlas-minecraft-textures-atlas-gui-png.raw`), and matching
`widget/button` - 200x20 pixels of vanilla resource pack - against it reported its *last* row at
y = 1022 with the rows running upwards, i.e. the sprite mirrored about the middle of the atlas.
Flipping the dumped atlas made it look like a normal `gui.png` again. After the fix the same match
reports the sprite's *first* row at (723, 1), rows running downwards, which is the coordinate the
stitcher packed it at.

### The scissor rectangle is OpenGL's, and is forwarded as it is

`RenderPassBackend#enableScissor` used to be a no-op on the grounds that 26.1 never calls it. It
does: a title screen that walks into the options screen logs two rectangles (`0 120 854 262` and
`0 98 2562 1137`), and `GuiItemAtlas` sets one around every item it renders into its atlas. Both
callers build the rectangle the OpenGL way - `GuiRenderer#enableScissor` as
`windowHeight - bottom * guiScale`, `GuiItemAtlas` as `textureSize - bottom` - which is measured
from the target's origin row, the row this backend renders into. So it is forwarded unchanged, and
only clamped: OpenGL clips a scissor box that reaches outside the framebuffer and wgpu *rejects*
one, and the rectangle a scaled GUI hands over can reach past the edge (`2562` wide in an `854` wide
window).

### Reading the settings before they are needed

`sendRunDirectory` loads `config/wgpu-mc-renderer.json` and was called from
`FMLClientSetupEvent`, which fires *after* `Minecraft`'s constructor has already created the
window, the wgpu instance, the adapter and the swapchain. The `backend` setting was therefore read
after the decision it controls had been made, and switching to DirectX 12 did nothing at all. The
mod constructor now reads it - `FMLPaths.GAMEDIR` is available that early - and `sendRunDirectory`
became idempotent, because `OnceCell::set` on the second call used to `unwrap()` into a panic, and
the panic hook exits the game.

### A shader that came back with the wrong operator

The world drew its sky, its clouds, its sun and its fog and then a *white void* where the terrain
should be. Every input the terrain shader asks for turned out to be correct - the block atlas bound
to `Sampler0`, the lightmap to `Sampler2`, `Globals` carrying `ScreenSize` 854x480, `ChunkSection`
carrying a sane `ModelViewMat` - and the answer was in the *shader source we hand to naga*:

```glsl
rgssColorLow *= 0.25;   // terrain.fsh, as Minecraft ships it
rgssColorLow -= 0.25;   // what came out of our preprocessor
```

`rgssColorLow` is the sum of four rotated-grid samples, so averaging it is a multiplication. Turned
into a subtraction, every RGSS-filtered surface - the user's `Filtering: RGSS` setting - comes out
at *four times* its colour minus a quarter, which clips to white. That is the whole symptom: terrain
that is drawn, in the right place, with the right texture, and then blown out.

The blame is `cyntax`'s lexer, which had a copy-paste error in its two-character punctuators:

```rust
span!(range, '*') if matches!(self.chars.peek(), Some(span!('='))) => {
    PreprocessingToken::Punctuator(Punctuator::MinusEqual),   // *= parsed as -=
```

`*=` was the only operator affected - `+=`, `-=`, `/=`, `%=`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `<<=`, `>>=` all
survived - which is why nothing else in the game looked wrong. The crate is now **vendored** at
`rust/cyntax` with the one-line fix, instead of being pinned to a revision of a fork, and
`preprocessing.rs` carries three tests that run every compound assignment through the preprocessor
and assert it comes back unchanged. They fail against the old revision.

### Not every Minecraft topology is a triangle list

`PrimitiveTopology` used to be translated with `match … { _ => TriangleList }`, which is right for
exactly one of the two shapes that matter:

- `QUADS` *is* a triangle list and has to stay one - Minecraft's index buffer for the mode expands
  each quad into `i, i+1, i+2, i+2, i+3, i` on the CPU - so the GUI and the terrain kept working and
  hid the bug.
- `LINES` is not. Its index buffer is `i, i+1, i+2, i+3, i+2, i+1`, three line segments per group of
  four vertices, because `rendertype_lines.vsh` expands each pair into a quad through
  `gl_VertexID % 2`. Drawn as triangles, the F3 overlay's 3D crosshair became long thin triangles
  across the whole screen - the "pointer stretched along the diagonal" - and so did every hitbox and
  chunk border.

`TRIANGLE_FAN` has no wgpu equivalent at all, so `draw_indexed` expands it: Minecraft's fan indices
are the sequential range, and the triangles are `(0,1,2), (0,2,3), …`, so a cached index buffer is
built per size and bound for that draw. The same change had to zero the depth bias for line and
point topologies, because wgpu rejects it there - `Depth bias is not compatible with non-triangle
topology LineList` - and OpenGL ignores polygon offset for lines too.

### Two ways a screenshot could not work

Pressing F2 ended the process. `Screenshot.takeScreenshot` reads a whole 854-wide target in one
`copy_texture_to_buffer` call, this side passed `bytes_per_row = width * 4` straight through, and
wgpu requires a multiple of 256:

```
wgpu error: Validation Error
Bytes per row does not respect `COPY_BYTES_PER_ROW_ALIGNMENT`
```

A validation error is fatal here - it runs the panic hook - so the fix is the one `dump_texture_rgba`
had always used: copy through a padded scratch buffer and write the rows back one at a time. With
that fixed the screenshot was *black*, because the read half of `mapBuffer` had never been
implemented: the staging buffer was allocated, handed to Blaze3D and freed without ever being filled
from the GPU. `read_buffer` now maps (through a scratch buffer of this side's own, so a buffer
Minecraft maps itself is left alone), waits for the GPU and fills it.

Two more diagnostics came out of the same dig, both behind the `wgpu-dump-frames` marker:

- a file named `wgpu-dump-shaders` in the run directory writes every pipeline's *processed* GLSL to
  `wgpu-shaders/`, which is the only way to see the binding numbers and the operators a shader was
  actually compiled with;
- the first bind of each sampler logs *which texture* it got (`pass Section layers for opaque binds
  Sampler0 to minecraft:textures/atlas/blocks.png`), and the first bind of each uniform reads its
  bytes back and logs them as floats and ints. Buffers now carry `COPY_SRC` for exactly this - the
  same thing textures already did - except the mappable ones, where wgpu rejects the combination.

A panic also writes itself to `wgpu-panic.txt` in the run directory now. A native crash takes
whatever stderr still had buffered with it, which is why the first screenshot crash left a crash
report with no message anywhere in the log.

### Five crashes that were all one mistake about pointers

The session that first reached a world alive died twice within a minute of getting there, each time
on a wgpu validation error, and neither death was Minecraft's fault. The liveness registry that
decides whether a texture may still be used was keyed on `&wgpu::Texture` - and `create_texture`
registered the address of its own *local*, while the pointer the JVM is handed is the address of the
`Box` built from it. Every live texture was therefore unlisted, and the allocator hands a freed box's
address straight back out, so a brand new texture was regularly recognised as its dead predecessor:

- the "after it was closed" warning fired on healthy textures, and the texture was replaced by the
  placeholder the registry exists to hand out;
- the placeholder was 1x1, so the pass that drew into it with the real target's scissor died on
  `Scissor Rect { x: 0, y: 0, w: 878, h: 504 } is not contained in the render target (1, 1, 1)`;
- a clear whose colour *and* depth texture were both "closed" built a render pass with no
  attachments at all: `No color attachments or depth attachments were provided`;
- the swapchain recovery called `configure_surface_inner`, which returned early because the
  configuration was *unchanged* - and the unchanged configuration is what was broken. It logged
  `still no swapchain image after reconfiguring: Validation` once per frame for 1633 frames while
  the window showed nothing;
- the buffer side had no registry at all, so the same use-after-close ended the run as
  `In Queue::write_buffer - Buffer with 'Cloud UTB #1' label is invalid`. Minecraft closes that
  uniform texel buffer and writes to it in the same frame.

Each one is fixed where it belongs. The registry is keyed on the boxed address, which is what
`drop_texture` sees again, so a live texture is never mistaken for a dropped one; the tombstone
remembers the label, size and format it was dropped with, because none of those may be read out of a
freed texture; a placeholder is the size the real texture had, since wgpu checks every scissor
against the render target; a clear with nothing left to clear returns instead of building an empty
pass; the swapchain recovery reconfigures *forcibly*; and a closed buffer is quarantined for half a
second - or until the quarantine is over its byte budget - before it is really dropped, which makes
the cloud buffer's write land in a buffer that still exists.

What the guards are for - Minecraft rebuilding a render target on a resize and something in the same
frame still holding the old textures - has not gone away, and a genuine use-after-close now logs the
label, size and format it was refused for. In a full run of the fixed build there were none.

### The leak was one command encoder per Minecraft command encoder

The game grew from one gigabyte to twenty in a minute and took the machine with it, from the very
first frames and with no gameplay involved. The counters that eventually found it - live textures,
views, buffers, passes, bind groups and encoders, printed every 120 frames - showed everything flat
except one line:

```
live resources: 767 textures (74 MB), 786 views, 47 buffers (0 MB, 5 quarantined), 1 encoders, ...
```

The number before that fix was 24000 and climbing by about 960 a second. `CommandEncoder` in
Blaze3D is **not** `AutoCloseable` and has no `close`: it is a plain object that the garbage
collector takes away, which is free in the OpenGL backend, whose encoder owns nothing. Here every
one of them owned a `wgpu::CommandEncoder` - a D3D12 command allocator and command list holding the
frame's recording - and none of that is visible to the Java heap, so nothing ever collected it:

- three encoders a frame (`Minecraft#runTick` makes one per frame, and the renderer more),
- a few hundred frames a second, because this backend runs without vsync in the menus,
- about 200 KB of command buffer each, which is the 200 MB/s the process was growing at.

Every handle now shares **one** native encoder, and the pointer the JVM holds is an empty box. The
recording order is what matters and everything is recorded on the render thread in call order, so
one encoder is enough; `flush_encoder` submits what has been recorded and starts a new one, exactly
as before. A cleaner that gave the encoder back when the object was collected was written first and
is not enough on its own: the collector has no reason to run, because the memory it cannot see is
the memory that matters.

Two other things came out of the same dig: `present_surface` now polls the device, because wgpu
frees a submission's command buffers and staging memory when it is polled and the GPU has caught up,
and the diagnostics that read a uniform back are rationed to four a second. The readback flood was
doing 4722 readbacks for the blocks atlas alone - Minecraft binds one uniform *per sprite* while it
animates an atlas, and keying the "report this again" set by offset instead of by name made every
sprite a fresh readback, each one allocating, submitting and waiting.

### One plan for a pipeline's bindings

Three things have to agree about where a binding lives: the wgpu `BindGroupLayout` that the pipeline
is built against, the `layout(binding = N)` annotations written into the GLSL, and the entries and
dynamic offsets of the bind group handed to `set_bind_group` at draw time. They used to be derived
separately - by a walk of the pipeline descriptor, by a map built for the shader rewriter, and by
another walk in `finalize_binding_builder` - and they disagreed, which is how a bind group came to
carry an offset list in one order while its layout expected another.

`blaze::BindGroupPlan` is now the single description, computed once per pipeline variant:

- `BindGroupPlan::number` numbers the bindings from the pipeline description, one per buffer and two
  per combined sampler. The GLSL annotations are written from `shader_locations()`, which is that
  numbering; the wgpu layouts come from `create_layouts()`; the bind group entries and the dynamic
  offsets come from walking `sets`, so the offsets list cannot be in a different order from the
  layout's dynamic bindings - it *is* that order.
- The uniform blocks a shader declares but the pipeline never listed are appended to the plan at the
  binding numbers the shader rewriter reserved for them. That replaced `with_implicit_uniforms`,
  which cloned the whole descriptor and leaked a `CString` per entry per pipeline; the descriptor
  copy is gone with it.
- `min_binding_size` is no longer left unset. `reflected_block_sizes` parses the preprocessed GLSL
  with naga and reads each uniform block's size out of it - the same view wgpu validates against - so
  a layout declares what the shader reads and the binding is checked when it is created rather than
  being left to wgpu's late per-draw check.

The defects the same review turned up:

- **A dynamic offset is a `u32`** and the slice offsets are `u64`, so an offset past four gigabytes
  would have been truncated into a binding that pointed somewhere else. An offset that does not fit
  is now baked into the binding instead of being handed over as a dynamic one.
- **`roundToward(length, 16)` ran past the end of the buffer.** The JVM rounds a slice's length up to
  the sixteen bytes a uniform range wants, and a slice whose last byte was the buffer's last byte
  became a binding four bytes too large, which wgpu refuses. Both sides clamp now: the JVM stops the
  rounding at the buffer's end, and `binding_size` clamps again where the buffer is in hand, so the
  size is never past the end and never smaller than the shader's block.
- **A storage buffer was given a dynamic offset** it cannot have - DX12 has no offset for a storage
  descriptor - while the layout did not declare one. That was the "BindGroup expects 4 dynamic
  offsets. However 5 dynamic offsets were provided" that ended a run. Only uniform bindings are
  dynamic now, and the offsets list is built from the plan's uniform bindings alone.

**Dynamic offsets are on.** The plan gives the order, the offsets are built in it, the alignment and
the `u32` are checked per binding, and an offset that fails either check is baked into the binding
instead with a zero offset, which lands on the same range. What held the switch off was that a
multi-binding layout drew *wrong* with it - which turned out to be the bind group cache keyed on the
builder's map slot rather than on the resource, so it answered with a set built for a different
texture; see "The cache was keyed on the wrong address". With that fixed, a world renders correctly
with 327560 of 327680 draws served from the cache. `wgpu-no-dynamic-offsets` turns the feature off,
and `wgpu-dynamic-offset-names` (a comma-separated list) restricts it to some uniforms, which is how
one binding at a time can be ruled in or out.

### The sky came out as one forty-five degree wedge

`SkyRenderer#buildSkyDisc` writes a centre vertex and nine rim vertices forty-five degrees apart,
draws them with `RenderPass#draw(0, 10)`, and binds a `TRIANGLE_FAN` pipeline. wgpu has no fan
topology, and this side only expanded fans for *indexed* draws - which is where Minecraft's
sequential fan index buffer goes. The disc, drawn with no index buffer at all, was forwarded as a
plain triangle list: wgpu paired the vertices up sequentially, so only `(0, 1, 2)` was a real fan
triangle and the rest of the sky was missing. What that looks like in a world is a blue wedge 45°
wide on a white background, which a player reasonably describes as "there is no fog in that
direction" - the sky is where the fog gradient is.

Non-indexed draws are now expanded by topology as well: a fan becomes `(0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 3), ...`
over a generated index buffer, and a run of quads becomes Minecraft's own quad pattern
(`i, i+1, i+2, i+2, i+3, i`). The frame dump made this obvious, which is the whole point of having
one: `node .dsh-tmp/raw2png.mjs` on `frame-N-source.raw` showed the wedge directly.

### A texel of `CloudFaces` is one byte, not one `int`

The clouds were drawn but wrong: a handful of faces near the camera instead of a layer, which reads
as "only the chunk I am standing in has clouds". `CloudRenderer#encodeFace` writes **three bytes**
per face - `cellX >> 1`, `cellZ >> 1`, and a direction-and-flags byte - and
`rendertype_clouds.vsh` fetches `texelFetch(CloudFaces, face * 3 + n)`, so the buffer's texel format
is R8I: one texel is one byte. This side's texel-buffer shim declared the SSBO as `int[]` and read
`inner[index]`, which takes *four* bytes per fetch, so every field after the first came out of the
wrong place and the decoded cell coordinates were nonsense. The shim now declares a `uint[]` and
extracts the byte:

```glsl
ivec4(((int((CloudFaces.inner[uint(index) >> 2u] >> ((uint(index) & 3u) << 3u)) & 0xFFu) ^ 0x80) - 0x80), 0, 0, 1)
```

**And the byte is signed, which was the second half of the same bug.** The first version of this
fetch zero-extended it, on the reasoning that every use of a fetched value in that shader is a mask
or a shift - which is true of the *flags* byte and false of the coordinates: a cell west or north of
the camera has a negative coordinate, so `cellX >> 1` is negative, and zero-extending `-3` gives
`509`. Every one of those cells was drawn about twenty times further away than it should have been,
which put them outside the fog. What was left was the two-by-two cells around the player, drifting
with the cloud offset and snapping back whenever the centre cell changed - the report was "one square
of cloud above my head that bounces", and it is exactly what half a cloud layer drawn 6 km away looks
like. `(byte ^ 0x80) - 0x80` is the sign extension, chosen over a shift pair because it does not
depend on how a backend shifts a signed value.

The tests encode Minecraft's byte layout, decode it back - with negative coordinates now, which the
first version's test never did - and check that the four-byte read the shim used to do gives a
different answer, so a future change to the layout has to fail a test rather than a screenshot.

### The cloud layer was one square, and the reason was `COPY_DST`

Fixing the byte layout was not enough, because the shader was not reading the faces at all. A mapped
write - `mapBuffer` on the JVM side, `write_to_buffer` on this one - is `Queue::write_buffer`, a copy
from the CPU, and wgpu refuses that on a buffer created without `COPY_DST`. Vanilla asks for
`USAGE_COPY_DST` on the buffers it uploads into, but **not** on the ones it maps itself, and the cloud
face buffer is one of those (`USAGE_MAP_WRITE | USAGE_UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER`): 181,824 bytes of faces
were written on the CPU every time the mesh was rebuilt, never copied to the GPU, and the shader read
the zeroes the buffer was created with. Every face decoded to cell `(0, 0)` facing down - one square
of cloud above the player's head, drifting with the cloud offset, and nothing else in the sky. The
buffer creation now asks for `COPY_DST` for anything `MAP_WRITE` as well, since that is how this side
uploads.

Two things came out of it that are worth keeping:

- `write_to_buffer` refuses to write into a buffer without `COPY_DST` and says so at error level. A
  wgpu validation error would end the process instead, and the *silent* version of this - a write
  that never happened - cost an afternoon: the clouds were drawn, from zeroes, with nothing in the
  log to say why. `read_buffer` also stopped refusing buffers Minecraft maps itself, because this
  side's mappings are CPU staging buffers rather than wgpu mappings, so there was nothing to disturb.
- With diagnostics on, a mapped write to a `Cloud*` buffer is **read back and compared** with what was
  sent, once a second. It compares the whole written range rather than a prefix, counts the non-zero
  bytes on both sides, and names the entry point and the wgpu usage flags the buffer ended up with:
  `all 30099 written bytes arrived in Cloud UTB #1 (30099 of them non-zero); created via createBuffer,
  blaze usage MAP_WRITE|UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER, wgpu usage MAP_WRITE|COPY_DST|STORAGE|COPY_SRC`. A mesh
  that arrives with its second half missing passes a 16-byte check, and the second half is what draws
  the rest of the layer.
- The same report decodes the buffer as **faces**, which is what the shader will make of it:
  `Cloud UTB #1 holds 10033 faces: x -86..86, z -86..86, 0 beyond 120 cells, 48 marked inside;
  directions down=9985 north=8 south=6 west=17 east=17; first [0,0 down inside] ...`. A mesh of real
  cells and a mesh of zeroes look identical in a screenshot - both are one square of cloud above the
  player - and this is the line that tells them apart without a GPU debugger.
- A draw that reads further than the write reached warns, once a second: `a draw reads 9987 faces
  (29961 bytes) from Cloud UTB #2 but only 120 bytes were uploaded into it`. The texel buffer is bound
  as a storage buffer here, so the draw's range and the upload's range are two numbers this side has
  and can compare, and "the shader is reading stale faces" stops being invisible.

### The same usage mask made three different buffers

The `COPY_DST` fix above was made in `create_buffer`, and `create_buffer_init` and
`allocate_gpu_buffer_mapped` had their own copies of the same translation. They had drifted:
`create_buffer_init` never translated `USAGE_UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER` to `STORAGE`, so a texel buffer
created with initial contents was a buffer no texel-buffer bind group could bind, and
`allocate_gpu_buffer_mapped` ignored the usage mask it was handed altogether and created
`MAP_READ | MAP_WRITE`. Any of those is a wgpu validation error - which ends the process here - and
the bug only hides as long as vanilla happens not to take that path. There is now one function,
`wgpu_buffer_usages`, and all three entry points call it; the mapped one adds `MAP_WRITE` on top,
because `mapped_at_creation` requires it, and drops `MAP_READ` when the mask asks for `COPY_SRC`,
because wgpu rejects that pair.

The JVM side can ask what a buffer ended up with (`buffer_usages`), which is what puts the flags into
the log lines above: the mask the JVM passes is not the mask the buffer has.

### A bounds check naga will not compile

An out-of-range `texelFetch` is undefined in GL, and until the sign extension was fixed this side's
texel-buffer shim was reading one: the fetch clamps its index in the natural way,

```glsl
ivec4(((uint(index) >> 2u) < uint(CloudFaces.inner.length()) ? byte : 0), 0, 0, 1)
```

and that shader does not compile. naga 29's GLSL front end lowers `.length()` on a runtime-sized
array member to a `Load` of the array rather than a pointer to it, and its validator answers
`InvalidPointerType` - in an expression, in a local, in a comparison, and in an `if` condition alike;
all four were tried. A shader module that fails validation is a wgpu error, which is fatal here, so
the first run with the clamp in it died in `create_shader_module` with the process's own crash log.

The clamp is left out, and it costs nothing: **WebGPU requires robust buffer access**, so an
out-of-bounds read of a storage buffer reads zero rather than the word after the mesh, which is what
the clamp was there to guarantee. `a_length_bounds_check_is_still_impossible` runs naga over the
idiom and fails if a later version starts accepting it, so the clamp goes back in when it can. The
test that would have caught the crash - `the_rewritten_texel_fetch_survives_naga` - runs the
rewritten fetch through naga's front end and validator, because "this is valid GLSL" and "naga
compiles this" are two different claims and only the second one keeps the game running.

### The mesh is rebuilt when the cell changes, and that is what vanilla does

`CloudOffset` is written into the `CloudInfo` uniform every frame, but the face buffer is only
rebuilt when the *cell* the camera is over changes, when the camera moves above or below the layer,
when the cloud status changes, or when the renderer asks for it - `CloudRenderer#render` compares
`cellX`/`cellZ` against the previous frame's, and `MappableRingBuffer#rotate` moves to the next of
three buffers for the new mesh. A cell is 12 blocks and the drift covers one in 400 ticks, so at a
walk that is a rebuild every few seconds and a stationary camera rebuilds every twenty, all of it
intended: the offset moves the layer smoothly and the mesh only has to be laid out again when a whole
cell has been crossed. What would *not* be intended is a frame drawn with a mesh from a different
cell, and that is what the draw-range warning and the face decode above exist to catch.

### The cloud ring was rebuilt every frame, because the buffer reported the wrong size

`COPY_DST` made the faces arrive, and the faces were a layer - the diagnostics read the buffer back,
decoded it, and printed `Cloud UTB #1 holds 9783 faces: x -85..85, z -85..85`. The sky stayed empty
anyway, one square of cloud over the player's head at best, flickering.

`GpuBuffer#size` is not a description, it is an *interface*: `CloudRenderer#render` compares
`this.utb.currentBuffer().size()` against the `utbSize` it computed, and rebuilds the ring of three
face buffers whenever they differ:

```java
if (this.utb == null || this.utb.currentBuffer().size() != utbSize) { ... this.utb = new MappableRingBuffer(...); }
```

wgpu needs buffer sizes to be a multiple of 16, and this side rounded every size *up* before handing
it to `GpuBuffer` - so the vanilla `utbSize` of 181,818 was reported back as 181,824, the comparison
never matched, and **the ring was closed and recreated on every frame of every cloud draw**. A
recreated ring is three freshly created, zeroed buffers, and on a frame where the cell did not change
nothing is written into them: the draw bound a buffer of zeroes, every face decoded to cell `(0, 0)`
facing down, and the whole layer collapsed into one square that drifted with the cloud offset. On the
frames where a rebuild did happen, the mesh was written into the new buffer and the layer appeared -
which is the flicker.

The rounded size now goes to wgpu and the size Minecraft asked for is what the buffer reports. The
diagnostic that names it exists because a buffer created sixty times a second is not visible in a
screenshot: `created buffer Cloud UTB #0 (181818 bytes asked for, 181824 bytes allocated)`, once for
the run instead of three times a frame.

Two smaller alignment bugs came out of the same change, both of which used to end the process with a
wgpu validation error rather than a wrong picture:

- **A readback has to be aligned at both ends.** `read_buffer` copies through a scratch buffer, and
  the diagnostic that verifies a mapped write asks for exactly the bytes that were written - which is
  `3 * faces`, i.e. a multiple of four only when the face count is. `Copy size 29349 does not respect
  COPY_BUFFER_ALIGNMENT` took the client down, and once that was fixed, `map_async` answered
  `range_size 29349 must be multiple of 4`. The copy is widened to alignment - offsets included - and
  the caller still gets exactly the bytes it asked for.
- **A bind group's buffer binding size has to be aligned too.** `setUniform` rounds a slice's length
  up to 16 and then clamps it to what is left of the buffer, and the clamp is what put the unrounded
  181,818 back: `Effective buffer binding size 181818 for storage buffers is expected to align to 4`.
  Rounding *down* to the four-byte alignment is what satisfies both a storage binding and a uniform
  block, and it can never run past the end of the buffer, which is what the clamp was for.

### What this side hands out, and what brings it back

Every one of these is a `Box` whose address the JVM holds, and a missing `drop` on the far side
leaks it and everything it owns. Blaze3D is not much help: `CommandEncoder` and
`CompiledRenderPipeline` are neither of them `AutoCloseable`, and `RenderPipeline` has no `close`
either, so two of these lifetimes had to be invented rather than implemented.

| Native object | Held by | Released by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `wgpu::Texture` | `WgpuTexture` | `close` → `drop_texture` | Minecraft closes its textures; the tombstone keeps the label for a later use-after-close |
| `wgpu::TextureView` | `WgpuTextureView` | `close` → `drop_texture_view` | |
| `wgpu::Buffer` | `WgpuBuffer` | `close` → `drop_buffer` | kept alive for two seconds afterwards, because Minecraft writes to the cloud buffer after closing it |
| `wgpu::Sampler` | `WgpuSampler` | `close` → `drop_sampler` | |
| `wgpu::CommandEncoder` | every `CommandEncoder` handle | nothing: there is one for the session | Minecraft makes three a frame and never frees any |
| `BlazePipeline` ×2 | `WgpuCompiledRenderPipeline` | `clearCaches`, or a cleaner → `drop_pipeline` | one per depth state; `clearCaches` is what Minecraft calls on a resource reload |
| `wgpu::BindGroup`s | one set per plan per pipeline, owned by the pass or the cache | when the pass closes, or when the cache evicts the least recently used set past 256 | see below |
| `wgpu::RenderPass` | `WgpuRenderPass` | `close` → `drop_render_pass` | with the draw call buffer, which goes back to the thread that owns it |

The caches are all bounded, and they report their size every 120 frames with the diagnostics on
(`… 184 pipelines, 486 tombstones, 0 fan + 0 quad index buffers`):

| Cache | Bound | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| compiled pipelines | Minecraft's own pipeline set, one depth variant at a time | reused per `RenderPipeline`; freed on a reload; the other depth variant is compiled when a pass first needs it - see "One depth variant, compiled when a pass asks for it" |
| shader sources | the shader variants in use | reused per `(id, stage, defines)`; cleared with the pipeline cache |
| driver pipeline cache | one file per adapter, ~1 MB | wgpu's `PipelineCache`, written by Vulkan; nothing to persist on DX12 |
| dead-texture tombstones | 512, oldest first | a tombstone only has to outlive the frame that closed the texture |
| placeholder textures | one per format, grown on demand | the stand-in for a closed texture; a window resize used to leave a full-size texture behind at every size it had ever been |
| fan and quad index buffers | 64 sizes, then emptied | rebuilt on demand; the buffers are a few kilobytes |
| quarantined buffers | 500 ms or 32 MB, oldest evicted first | a byte budget rather than a count: the entries are megabytes each, and a count of them was hundreds of megabytes |
| `CommandEncoder` | 1 | see above |
| diagnostics sets | once per name, or one entry per second | the readback budget keeps its "already warned" second in a field, not in a set that grows once a second for the whole session |
| interned names | one per name the game asks for | see "A name is encoded once" below; the set follows the loaded assets |
| draw call buffers | one per pass open at a time, per thread | pooled rather than allocated; see "One downcall per draw" |

A resource reload is the test for the pipeline half: three of them in a row leave the count at 184,
where it used to climb by 184 each time.

### Bind groups are built per draw, and the cache that was meant to stop it

A bind group was built for every draw and freed as soon as the draw call returned, which the
counters make plain:

```
render stats: … 244945 draws (244945 bind groups built), …
```

That is bounded - the live count is zero whenever it is sampled, and `BindGroups_`'s `Drop` is what
decrements it - but it is one `wgpu::BindGroup` per draw, sixty to eighty thousand a second at the
title screen. The obvious fix is to reuse the last set while nothing has been re-bound, so the pass
now owns its set and rebuilds it only when something changes. Then the measurement that says whether
that was worth anything:

```
wgpu: 81025 draws, 81025 of them had to rebuild their bind groups
```

Every draw. Minecraft re-binds at least one uniform for every draw it makes - a chunk section's
matrix, an entity's transform, a GUI element's pose - and a bind group bakes the buffer *offset*
into itself, so no two of them are alike. The reuse path is therefore correct and never taken, which
is what **dynamic offsets** are for: one bind group per pipeline, with the moving offset passed at
bind time. `min_uniform_offset_alignment` is exported for it and Minecraft's uniform ring already
aligns its slices to it.

The offset was then left out of the cache key, so that a set could be shared between draws that
differ only in it, and the reuse arrived - 99.96% of draws served from the cache - **with the frame
disassembled**: the world came out as a checkerboard of dark tiles, the hotbar was a cyan smear, and
every slot of a sprite atlas held the same sprite. See "The cache was keyed on the wrong address"
for what that turned out to be.

The same pass found the buffer quarantine holding far more than it needs: the use-after-close it
guards against happens *within a frame*, so two seconds and a thousand entries became half a second
and a hundred and twenty-eight, and the title screen's 162 quarantined buffers - 676 MB live between
them, because Minecraft's uniform rings are megabytes each - became 57.

A count was still the wrong unit, because the entries are not one size. It is a **byte budget** now:
half a second or 32 MB, oldest evicted first, and the stat line says how much is held rather than
only how many. In the runs since, a world holds 100-odd quarantined buffers in 5-25 MB, where the
same count could have been hundreds of megabytes. A single buffer larger than the budget still gets
its quarantine - dropping it would mean the write Minecraft is about to make hits a buffer that is
already gone, which is the fatal case this exists for - so the budget is a target, not a hard cap.

### The cache was keyed on the wrong address

The bind group cache is keyed by a hash of everything a set is built from, and for a buffer that was
`buffer as *const wgpu::Buffer` - the address of the `wgpu::Buffer` *the builder's map holds*, not of
the buffer. It is a clone of the handle Rust was handed, stored under the binding's name, so its
address is the address of that map slot: one per name, reused by every draw that binds that name,
**whatever it binds to it**.

That is fine while a name always means the same resource. It is not fine for the sprite atlas, where
Minecraft binds a different texture view to `Sprite` for every sprite, or for the uniform buffers it
hands out one per draw: the key stayed the same, so the cache answered with the set built for the
*first* one - a set holding the first sprite's view and the first draw's buffers - and every draw
after it sampled the wrong texture. Which is exactly what the picture showed: one sprite copied into
every slot of the atlas, terrain tiles drawn from a single wrong uniform, a hotbar that was one
stretched quad.

The old key escaped this in baked mode by accident: the uniform offset was part of it, and Minecraft
hands out a fresh (buffer, offset) pair almost every draw, so the keys almost never repeated - 0.6%
of draws were cache hits, and those few were the ones that could go wrong. Leaving the offset out of
the key, which is the whole point of dynamic offsets, turned that rare collision into the common
case.

The identity is now the pointer the JVM handed over - the address of the box Rust gave it, which
lives exactly as long as the resource does. It is also, and this is the point, the address
`invalidate_bind_group_cache` is called with when something is freed, so the cache and the
invalidation finally agree about what "the same buffer" means. Two smaller things came with it:

- `reflected_block_sizes` read `variable.name` out of naga, which is empty for a GLSL
  `layout(std140) uniform Block {...};` - the block's name is on the *type* - so it reflected nothing
  at all and every layout went out with `min_binding_size: None`. With the fallback in place the
  layouts declare the size the shader reads, which is what the plan was written to be able to do.
- The trace behind `wgpu-trace-dynamic-offsets` now prints what the plan decided per binding
  (identity, offset, size, dynamic or baked), which is how this was found at all.

Measured in a world afterwards, with dynamic offsets on and the frame correct:

```
render stats: 327680 draws (120 bind groups built, 327560 cache hits and 120 misses)
```

One hundred and twenty bind groups built for a third of a million draws, where it used to be one
per draw. The switches: `wgpu-no-dynamic-offsets` bakes the offsets instead, `wgpu-no-bind-group-cache`
builds a set per draw, and `wgpu-dynamic-offset-names` restricts the feature to a list of uniforms.

### One downcall per draw, and bindings by slot

The cache above made the bind groups rare; it did not make the *draw path* short. Every binding was
still its own downcall - `bind_render_pipeline_to_pass`, `bind_buffer`, `bind_texture_and_sampler`,
`set_index_buffer`, `set_vertex_buffer`, then `draw` or `draw_indexed` - and behind each one:

- the JVM allocated a `Box` for the pass's binding builder and one per binding resource, and the
  binding resource owned its name, so every binding copied a `String` into native memory;
- the native side hashed that name into a map per binding per draw, and `drop_bind_groups` freed
  the previous set on the way;
- the pass's bind groups lived behind a `Mutex`, the cache key was built with `DefaultHasher`
  (SipHash, chosen for HashDoS resistance in a `HashMap` that never sees untrusted input), and the
  cache's LRU counter was a global `fetch_add` - two atomics and a lock acquisition per draw, all
  to protect a structure only the render thread could reach.

None of that was measurable in a profile until it was gone, which is the usual argument for not
having written it. What replaced it:

**The plan is read once.** `pipeline_bindings` fills a caller-supplied array with one entry per
binding - the name, the declared name, the set, the binding number and the kind - and the JVM turns
that into a slot table per compiled pipeline (`PlanBindings`). From then on a binding is an index:
`bindTexture("Sprite", …)` resolves to two slots once and is written into them, and nothing on the
draw path looks a name up.

**A draw is one call.** `draw_call` carries a `DrawCall`: the pipeline, up to eight vertex buffers
with a presence mask, the index buffer and its format, up to 32 bindings by slot, and the four draw
parameters. The JVM writes into a buffer it owns as things are bound and fills in the parameters at
the draw, so the native side learns the whole state of the draw at once and applies it - pipeline,
vertex buffers, bind groups, index buffer, draw - in that order.

**The pass owns its bind groups.** `BlazeRenderPass` keeps the set it last bound, the key it was
built for, and the dynamic offsets per group. A draw that hashes to the key the pass already holds
reuses the set and hands over new offsets, which is the common case and involves no cache lookup at
all; the cache is consulted only when the key changes, and it answers with an `Arc` the pass keeps.
`drop_bind_groups` is gone: the last reference to a set is released when the pass closes or the
cache evicts it. Both cache maps are now thread-local `RefCell`s, keyed with `FxHasher`, and the
tick counter that finds the least recently used entry is a plain field. What still needs an atomic
is invalidation from *another* thread - the cleaner that frees a collected pipeline cannot name
entries in a cache it does not own - so it bumps an epoch and the next lookup on the render thread
drops everything.

**A name is encoded once.** `NativeNames` interns the UTF-8 of every name into one `Arena.global()`
instead of an `Arena.ofConfined()` per call, which is what a buffer or texture label used to cost.
It reports its size every 4096 names, because the argument for an unbounded intern table is an
argument about where the names come from: they are labels Minecraft wrote by hand or derived from
asset names, and the few that carry a number carry a bounded one (`"… animation frame 3"`,
`"UberBuffer solid 7"`).

**The draw call buffer is pooled.** A pass wrote into `arena.allocate(DrawCall)` from an arena it
then closed - an arena, an allocation and a close per pass, tens of times a frame. A closed pass now
returns its buffer to its thread's pool and the next pass takes it back, clearing it first, since a
reused buffer otherwise still holds the previous pass's bindings, vertex buffer mask and index
buffer. Nested passes each take their own, so the pool holds one buffer per pass open at a time.

Measured in a world, with the diagnostics on:

```
render stats: 2160 render passes (0 of them empty, last had 1 draws), 2760 pipeline binds, 385320
draws (120 bind groups built, 2760 cache hits and 120 misses), 850193400 vertices
live resources: 774 textures (77 MB), 793 views, 98 buffers (418 MB, 12 quarantined), 1 encoders,
0 passes, 76 bind groups, 196 pipelines, 412 tombstones, 1 fan + 0 quad index buffers
```

The `pipeline binds` counter is the one that shows what the pass keeping its state is worth: 2760
binds for 385320 draws, one per hundred and forty draws, where every draw used to bind its pipeline.
The `cache hits` number *fell* from 327560 to ~2700 for the same reason - a draw that reuses the set
its pass already holds does not consult the cache at all - and 120 bind groups are still built per
interval, one per plan per pipeline. Nothing in the renderer frees a bind group per draw any more,
which is what the stable bind group count across a resource reload (`F3+T`) is: the cache drops, the
pipelines are freed, and both come back to the same size.

### One depth variant, compiled when a pass asks for it

A pipeline needs two `wgpu::RenderPipeline`s: a pass with a depth attachment cannot use one without
a depth-stencil state, and a pass without one cannot use a pipeline that has it. This side built
both, for every pipeline, the moment Minecraft precompiled it - and Minecraft precompiles *every*
pipeline it ships with, in `ShaderManager#apply`, whether or not a frame ever draws with it.

What made that expensive is not the driver's pipeline creation alone. `compile_render_pipeline`
preprocesses the GLSL, reflects it with naga, creates the shader modules and numbers the plan, and
all of that is the same for both variants; only `depth_stencil` differs. Doing it twice per pipeline
doubled the slowest part of startup for a variant that half the pipelines never used.

So a compiled pipeline is now one variant, plus a `PipelineRecipe`:

- `compile_render_pipeline` builds the recipe - shader modules, pipeline layout, vertex buffers,
  colour targets, topology, cull - and writes **one** pipeline from it. The JVM asks for the variant
  the binding pass needs (`precompilePipeline` asks for the one without depth state, since it does
  not know); the recipe is kept on the pipeline, so the shader work is over.
- The other variant is written by `create_pipeline_variant(pipeline, depth_state)` the first time a
  pass of the other kind draws with it: a `render_pipeline` from the modules and layout already in
  hand, and nothing else. That is also the call the pipeline cache accelerates.
- `drop_render_pipeline` takes a *nullable* pointer, because only one of the two slots may ever have
  been filled: freeing a compiled pipeline frees whichever variants exist.
- The plan is shared by both variants rather than numbered twice, and the ABI exposes a
  `variant_keys`-style single entry point rather than two descriptor compiles.

```
live resources: ... 85 bind groups, 115 pipelines, 500 tombstones, ...     ← 98 pipelines × 1 variant
                                                                              + the depth variants
                                                                              actually drawn with
```

**The driver's own cache is persistent.** `RenderPipelineDescriptor::cache` was `None`; it is now a
`wgpu::PipelineCache` created with the device, seeded from a file beside the config
(`wgpu_pipeline_cache_vulkan_<vendor>_<device>.bin`, the key wgpu's own `pipeline_cache_key`
suggests) and rewritten every 16 pipelines through a temporary file and a rename. Where it helps is
where the driver lets it: Vulkan implements it as `vkPipelineCache`, and DX12 has no serialisable
form at all - its adapter does not even offer the `PIPELINE_CACHE` feature - so on DX12 there is no
cache and no file, which the log says once instead of leaving a missing file unexplained:

```
wgpu-mc: pipeline cache: 1.2 MB written to ...\wgpu_pipeline_cache_vulkan_4318_11544.bin (started from 1.2 MB)
wgpu-mc: this device has no pipeline cache; every launch compiles every pipeline     ← the DX12 run
```

The two lines are one report: `report_pipeline_cache_once` runs from the first `log_render_stats`,
because the cache is created during mod construction, before the logger is up. The Vulkan numbers
above are a second launch - the first one wrote 1.29 MB, and the next one started from it and grew
no further, which is what "the driver reused its compilation" looks like from here.

The counter that says whether the laziness worked is `live resources`' pipeline count: 115 for a
world session, where compiling both variants of every precompiled pipeline put it at 196.

### Neither compiler checks the two bridges, so a test does

`WgpuNative.kt` names the native methods it wants, `WmNative.kt` names the C entry points and the
byte offsets of every struct field, and Rust names what it actually exports. Neither language knows
about the other's list, and every way the two can disagree is a *runtime* failure rather than a
compile error:

- an `external fun` with no `#[jni_fn]` throws `UnsatisfiedLinkError`, which is an `Error` - not
  something `catch (e: Exception)` sees - the first time that code path runs, which may be minutes
  into a session;
- a `handle("name", ...)` naming a symbol the cdylib does not export throws from
  `SymbolLookup#find` at whatever moment the handle is first touched;
- a field offset that drifted reads whatever happens to live at that byte instead, which shows up as
  a wrong colour or a wrong blend factor, not as an error.

`rust/wgpu-mc-jni/src/abi_tests.rs` therefore reads both Kotlin files, with `include_str!` (so
editing either one re-runs the test in `cargo test`), and checks them against this crate:

- every `external fun` in `WgpuNative.kt` has a `#[jni_fn]` here, with the same JVM argument count
  (Rust's two leading parameters are the `JNIEnv` and the class, so they do not count);
- every `handle("name", ...)` in `WmNative.kt` is a `#[no_mangle] extern "C"` export with the same
  argument count, and no export is left unbound;
- every `MemoryLayout.structLayout(...)` in `WmNative.kt` puts its fields where `offset_of!` puts
  them and is the size `size_of` reports - trailing `paddingLayout` entries included, which is how
  the 24-byte `BlazeColorTargetState` is spelled out - and the named `*_OFFSET` constants agree with
  the layout they describe;
- every `GpuFormat`, `UniformType`, `BlendFactor`, `CompareFunction` and `PrimitiveTopology` number
  is the one the Rust enum assigns, matched variant by variant, so adding a variant to either side
  fails the test rather than the frame.

The first run of that check found four things, all now deleted:

- **21 `external fun`s that nothing implemented.** They were the GPU-object half of the old JNI
  layer - `createTexture`, `createBuffer`, `createCommandEncoder`, `createBufferInit`,
  `dropTexture`, `dropBuffer`, `presentTexture`, `submitEncoders`, `getMaxTextureSize`,
  `getMinUniformAlignment`, `getRenderPassCommandSize`, `render`, `setCamera`, `setMatrix`'s
  neighbours `getMouseX`/`getMouseY`/`setCursorPosition`/`setCursorMode`, `setAllocator`,
  `updateWindowTitle`, `getTextureId`, `destroyPaletteStorage` - and Rust stopped exporting them
  when the C ABI took over that job. One of them was live: `WgpuTextureManager#getTextureId` called
  `WgpuNative.getTextureId`, so the class went with it. The file's own doc comment claimed these
  "mirror functions that still exist on the Rust side", which was exactly the assumption that made
  them dangerous.
- **Six `#[jni_fn]` implementations that nothing declared**, left over from the design where Rust
  owned the world: `setSectionPos`, `reloadStorage`, `bindRenderEffectsData`, `setLightmapID`,
  `clearEntities`, `setEntityInstanceBuffer`. Nothing in the crate called them either, so they could
  not run at all.
- **`extract_directives`**, a `#[no_mangle]` GLSL-directive dump from before the JNI layer, which
  nothing called and nothing bound.

What is left is 26 JNI declarations and 52 C-ABI bindings, each with an implementation on the other
side, and the test keeps it that way. Ten of the 26 are still only reachable from the old
Rust-renders-the-world path (`bakeSection`, the palette calls, `setMatrix`, `cacheBlockStates`,
`setWorldRenderState`, `createWmRenderer`): they resolve, and nothing in the backend calls them,
because chunk baking and skinning happen on the JVM side now. `cacheBlockStates` is the exception -
`TitleScreenMixin` starts a thread with `WgpuNative::cacheBlockStates` so the block-state colours are
baked while the title screen is up.

### Nothing ever culled a back face

Leaves and every other translucent surface had black ghosts in them and flickered while the camera
moved. Leaves are single-sided quads: in fancy graphics Minecraft meshes all six faces of every
leaf block, including the ones between two leaf blocks, and leaves it to `glCullFace(GL_BACK)` to
throw away whichever half of them faces away from the camera. This side never turned culling on.
The ABI had no field for it - 26.1's `RenderPipeline#isCull` was simply not forwarded - and both
pipeline-creation sites hardcoded `cull_mode: None`, so every quad was rasterized front *and* back.
On an opaque quad the second copy is hidden behind the first; on a blended one the two land at the
same depth, where which of them survives the depth test is not defined, and the back copy is shaded
with the far side's lighting. That is the ghosting, and the flicker is the same coin landing
differently as the view moves.

`cull` is now a field of the ABI's `RenderPipeline` (offset 80, `PIPELINE_CULL`), filled from
`RenderPipeline#isCull()` - which defaults to *true*, so a pipeline only gives up culling by asking,
exactly as `GlCommandEncoder` answers it with `GlStateManager._enableCull()`.

The winding is the part worth writing down, because getting it backwards deletes the world instead
of fixing it. The vertex shaders flip `gl_Position.y` to emulate GL's clip space (see
`EmulateGlClipSpace` in `rust/wgpu-mc-jni/src/preprocessing.rs`), and that mirror also mirrors the
winding: a triangle OpenGL calls counter-clockwise - and therefore front-facing - arrives at wgpu
clockwise. So the pairing that reproduces `glFrontFace(GL_CCW)` + `glCullFace(GL_BACK)` is
`front_face: wgpu::FrontFace::Cw` with `cull_mode: Some(wgpu::Face::Back)`.

`Ccw` was tried first, on the reasoning that "counter-clockwise in framebuffer coordinates" was
what the flip restored. It is not, and the way it fails is worth recognising: a single-sided quad
has no back face to fall back on, so culling the front ones removes the surface entirely. The world
came out as a pale blue sky with the sky box's dark lower half where the ground should have been,
the block outline still drawn around nothing, and the held item in the corner. The frame dump
(`wgpu-dump-now`, then `node .dsh-tmp/raw2png.mjs <frame>.raw bgra`) showed it as a scanned row of
`184,210,255` where the terrain used to be.

**One thing this does not forward is `PolygonMode`.** The single pipeline that asks for `WIREFRAME`
(`pipeline/wireframe`, the chunk-section debug view) still draws filled, because wgpu needs
`Features::POLYGON_MODE_LINE` for it and this device does not ask for that feature.

### Known gaps

- **The Fabric module's C header is a snapshot from before the 26.1 work.** `fabric/src/main/wgpu-mc.h`
  is what the Fabric backend's `jextract` bindings are generated from, and it is not
  `rust/wgpu-mc-jni/bindings.h`: it still declares the exports this session deleted (`dummy`,
  `thing`, `unmap_buffer`, `drop_buffer_view`, `extract_directives`) and older signatures for the
  ones that stayed (`create_texture_view` without the mip range, `create_render_pass` without the
  encoder handle). A Fabric build against the current cdylib would resolve handles that are no
  longer there, so migrating that module starts with regenerating its header from `bindings.h`.

- **A texture view can outlive its texture.** A long session ended with `In Texture::create_view —
  Texture with 'FBO 2 / Depth' label is invalid`: Minecraft rebuilt a render target - a resize does
  that - closed the old depth texture, and something still asked for a view of it. The JVM side used
  to hand the freed pointer to `create_texture_view`, and wgpu answers that with a validation error,
  which ends the process. `WgpuDevice#createTextureView` now checks `isClosed` first, logs whose
  texture it was, and hands back a view of a placeholder of the same format *and size*: one frame of
  the wrong content is a far better outcome than losing the session. The Rust side refuses a dropped
  pointer the same way, from the tombstone the drop recorded. The caller that keeps a view past its
  texture is still out there, and the log line names it.
- **The swapchain refuses an image** (`get_current_texture` returning `Validation`) when the window
  has been through something the configuration does not survive - a monitor change, a fullscreen
  toggle, a long idle. That used to be logged and dropped, frame after frame, for minutes on end.
  It now takes the same recovery path as `Outdated` and `Lost`: reconfigure from the stored size and
  present mode - forcibly, since an unchanged configuration is what the recovery is there to
  replace - and try once more, with the log line rate-limited to one every 120 frames.
- **The expansions are exercised by the sky and little else.** `TRIANGLE_FAN` and, for non-indexed
  draws, `QUADS` go through generated index buffers. The sky disc is the fan that matters and it is
  drawn every frame; the stars and the sun and moon are drawn from Minecraft's own quad index
  buffer and never take that path. `POINTS` and `DEBUG_LINE_STRIP` have no wgpu equivalent drawn
  here at all, because nothing in a normal run draws them.
- **Every `CommandEncoder` shares one native encoder.** That is what fixed the leak, and it is a
  deliberate assumption: recording happens on the render thread in call order, and wgpu allows one
  pass at a time, so the sharing is invisible. Two passes open at once - Minecraft holding two
  encoders each with a pass in flight - would be a wgpu validation error, and none has been seen in
  a run; if one ever appears, the layout is a per-encoder encoder with a lifetime this side cannot
  get from Blaze3D.

- **`setViewport` is not forwarded.** 26.1 never calls it - a full run with the diagnostics on logs
  no viewport request at all - so the default viewport is always in use. The default is the right
  one now that views carry their mip range: wgpu sizes the render area from the attachment's base
  mip level, which is what makes the per-level atlas passes render at 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 of the atlas
  rather than all at full size. A pass that does set a viewport would still be ignored, and would
  need the same clamping that the scissor rectangle gets.
- **A region clear widens to the whole attachment.** `glClear` is restricted by the scissor box and
  a wgpu load-op is not, so `clear_color_and_depth_textures_region` clears everything and warns
  once. Minecraft only reaches for it when redrawing one stale slot of the GUI item atlas, so the
  cost is the other cached slots of that atlas until they are allocated again. Doing it properly
  needs a scissored clear draw, i.e. a pipeline of its own.
- **`drawMultipleIndexed` replays its draws** instead of batching them, because there is no
  indirect-draw entry point in the ABI. Correct, just less batched.
- **Every draw builds its own bind groups.** This was true, and is no longer: dynamic offsets are on
  by default and the cache answers 99.96% of draws - see "The cache was keyed on the wrong address".
  What is left is the *first* draw of every distinct binding set, and a set that never repeats is
  still a `wgpu::BindGroup` of its own.
- **Timestamp queries and fences** are stubs until Rust exposes them.
- **`clearStencilTexture` is a no-op.** Nothing in 26.1's main paths calls it, and the depth
  attachments the port creates have no stencil to clear.
- **Two pipelines make naga warn about `@invariant`.** `Vertex shader with entry point main outputs
  a @builtin(position) without the @invariant attribute and is used in a pipeline with Equal` - the
  vertex stage is translated from GLSL by naga's frontend, which does not emit the attribute, and
  the pipelines that compare with `EQUAL` are the ones that care. On some drivers that can show as
  z-fighting between two passes that should match exactly; none was visible in the runs so far, and
  adding the attribute would mean post-processing naga's output rather than the GLSL.
- **Some pipelines declare samplers their shaders use, and some do not.** The run logs
  `the shader declares uniform Sampler0_wm_texshim, which the pipeline does not provide; giving it
  binding 5, which the pipeline layout will not have` at debug level - the same class of mismatch as
  `Globals`, in the sampler shim rather than the uniform one. It is not fatal, because naga drops the
  unused globals, but it means the pipeline cannot bind a sampler the shader may want. The two shim
  names are this side's own (`shim_samplers` splits a combined sampler in two), which is why they are
  no longer reported as an error: four alarming lines in every startup log for shaders that render
  fine.
- **A `ByteBuffer` upload in any format other than RGBA is stored as if it were RGBA.** That
  overload is handed a `NativeImage.Format` the native side is never told about; the port logs an
  error when it sees anything but `NativeImage.Format.RGBA` rather than corrupting the texture
  quietly. Only RGBA has ever been observed in a run.
- **Window resizing is exercised, but only on DX12 so far.** Three resizes in a row - including one
  that asked for a window taller than the screen - and a maximise to 2560x1334 with a world loaded
  both kept presenting, `acquired=true` on 5280 consecutive frames. The resize path is also what
  produces every use-after-close this side guards against, so it is the test that matters most; a
  Vulkan run of the same sequence is still owed.
- The remaining access-transformer entries were each re-verified against the 26.1 bytecode; entries
  whose target no longer exists are kept as `# REMOVED:` notes so a future rebase can tell
  "checked, gone" apart from "not checked yet".
