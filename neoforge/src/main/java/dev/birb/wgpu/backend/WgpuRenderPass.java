/**
 * Blaze3D's render pass, forwarding to a {@code wgpu::RenderPass}.
 *
 * <p>This one class is deliberately written in Java rather than Kotlin. Kotlin cannot override an
 * interface method declared with an unbounded type parameter, and {@code RenderPassBackend}
 * declares {@code <T> void drawMultipleIndexed(...)}; implementing the interface in Java is the
 * only way to satisfy it. The rest of the backend stays in Kotlin.
 *
 * <p>The interesting part of the port is the descriptor marshalling: {@code
 * BlazeRenderPassDescriptor} is a struct-of-structs in the C ABI, so the whole thing is built
 * inside one confined {@link Arena} whose lifetime is exactly the native call. Field offsets come
 * from {@link WmNative} so they can be checked against {@code bindings.h}.
 *
 * <p>Bindings are written into a {@code DrawCall} as they arrive, and a draw is one call across the
 * ABI carrying the pipeline, the buffers, the parameters and every binding by slot - see {@link #record}.
 * The bind groups themselves live in the native pass and are reused between draws.
