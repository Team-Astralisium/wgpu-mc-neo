/**
 * Appends wgpu-mc diagnostics to the F3 debug overlay.
 *
 * <p>1.21.1 exposed {@code DebugScreenOverlay#getSystemInformation()}, which this mixin wrapped on
 * {@code RETURN}. 26.1 removed it: {@code extractRenderState} now allocates one
 * {@code List<String>} per column and hands each of them to the private {@code extractLines},
 * which renders it immediately and returns nothing. There is no return value left to extend, but
 * the list itself is a parameter, and it is a fresh {@code ArrayList} on every call - so adding to
 * it is both safe and the only seam that does not need a shadowed field.
 *
 * <p>The two calls are the right column ({@code ordinal = 0}, the one passed {@code true}) and the
 * left column ({@code ordinal = 1}). The diagnostics go on the left, next to the rest of the
 * system information.
 *
 * <p>The line naming the renderer backend is not here: it belongs with the rest of the graphics
 * information, and {@link DebugEntrySystemSpecsMixin} puts it there.
 *
 * <p>An earlier revision collected the lines into a static field behind a public accessor instead.
 * Mixin rejects that outright - "contains non-private static method" - because a mixin may not
 * contribute a non-private method to its target. The field and the accessor are gone; the lines are
 * built here, once per frame, and only while the overlay is actually open.
