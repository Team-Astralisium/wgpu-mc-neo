/**
 * Tells the native side about every block and block state as they are registered.
 *
 * <p>This is what fills the block registry the Rust terrain baker reads - `AIR`, and the model behind
 * every state, come from it - so when it stopped firing the whole native block path went quiet: the
 * registry stayed empty, `cacheBlockStates` found nothing to bake, and a section offered for baking
 * was refused. Nothing said so, because an injection that lands on a method nobody calls is not an
 * error.
 *
 * <p>Which is exactly what had happened. 26.1 registers blocks through
 * {@code Registry.register(Registry, ResourceKey, T)}: `Blocks` builds a {@code ResourceKey} with
 * `vanillaBlockId(name)` and hands it to that overload, and NeoForge's `DeferredRegister` goes
 * through the same one. The mixin was written against `register(Registry, Identifier, T)`, the
 * overload the 1.21.1 port used - and the descriptor still existed, so it applied, and never ran.
