/**
 * Hands a section rebuild to the Rust terrain baker.
 *
 * The Rust side owns the meshing (`wgpu_mc::mc::chunk::bake_layers`) and the arena the result lands
 * in (`SectionStorage`); this side owns the world. What crosses the boundary is Minecraft's own data,
 * not a copy shaped for Rust:
 *
 *  - **The block storage goes over as it is.** A `PalettedContainer` is a palette plus a bit-packed
 *    storage, and the storage's geometry - `valuesPerLong`, `mask`, `divideMul`, `divideAdd`,
 *    `divideShift` and the raw longs - is read straight out of Minecraft's `SimpleBitStorage`. What
 *    Rust gets beside it is a **palette translation table**: `table[minecraft index]` is the block key
 *    Rust knows that state by. Two entries may name the same key - a waterlogged variant, say - which
 *    is exactly why the table exists: the indices stay Minecraft's, so nothing has to be renumbered
 *    and no storage has to be re-packed. (An earlier revision rebuilt a palette and packed a fresh
 *    `SimpleBitStorage` here, per section, per rebuild: 4096 `getAll` calls and a new bit-packing
 *    every time, for data the game was already holding.)
 *  - **Only what changed is sent.** Rust keeps a section until it is far from the player, and this side
 *    keeps what it has told Rust, so a section whose storage and light hash the same as last time goes
 *    over as one bit in a mask instead of a few kilobytes. Light especially: a rebuild of one section
 *    needs the light of 27, and re-sending all of them was 108 KB of copying, 54 array allocations and
 *    54 JNI calls each time, for data that changes when a torch is placed rather than when a chunk is
 *    re-meshed.
 *  - **Everything goes in one call.** The payload is written into one reusable off-heap buffer and
 *    handed over as an address; the old shape was ~57 JNI calls and 60 arrays per rebuild, and it
 *    allocated all of them per rebuild as well.
 *
 * Three things about the shape of the data are worth naming, because each is easy to get wrong:
 *
 *  - **The 27 entries are ordered x fastest, then y, then z.** That is the order the Rust provider
 *    indexes (`sx + sy * 3 + sz * 9`) and the order `RenderSectionRegion` keeps its own copies in.
 *  - **Light is a nibble array**, 2048 bytes for a 16x16x16 section, packed as
 *    `(y << 8) | (z << 4) | x` with the low nibble first - `DataLayer#getData` is exactly that.
 *  - **The sections come from the rebuild's own snapshot.** A `SectionCopy` holds a private copy of
 *    the section's `PalettedContainer`, so reading it is both consistent with the mesh Minecraft is
 *    building in the same task and safe off-thread (the live chunk is guarded by a threading
 *    detector). A position the snapshot does not cover is "not loaded", which is air to both sides.
 *
 * Nothing here runs unless the path is switched on - see [MARKER] - because until the render graph
 * draws these sections, a baked section is work nobody reads.
