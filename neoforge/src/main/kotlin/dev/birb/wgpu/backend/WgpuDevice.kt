/**
 * Blaze3D's GPU device, implemented on top of the wgpu renderer in `rust/wgpu-mc-jni`.
 *
 * This is the Kotlin counterpart of the Fabric module's `WgpuDevice`, adapted to the 26.1
 * `GpuDeviceBackend` contract: 26.1 has no `GpuSurfaceBackend`, so presenting is driven by
 * [WgpuCommandEncoder.presentTexture] and [presentFrame] instead of a surface interface.
 *
 * The renderer pointer comes from the JNI entry point `WgpuNative.createWmRendererOnWindow()`,
 * which returns the `*mut WmRenderer` owned by Rust. Every other call goes through the C ABI in
 * [WmNative] using that same pointer, so both bridges address one renderer instance.
