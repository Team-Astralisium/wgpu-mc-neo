/**
 * A Blaze3D [RenderPipeline] compiled into a native `wgpu::RenderPipeline`.
 *
 * A pipeline needs one native pipeline per depth configuration: Rust reads the depth state from the
 * presence of that struct field, and a render pass knows at bind time whether it has a depth
 * attachment ([forDepth]). Both are never needed at once - a GUI pipeline is drawn in a pass
 * without depth, a world pipeline in one with - so the variant that was asked for first is compiled
 * once, and the other is written the first time something draws with it ([createVariant]). Minecraft
 * precompiles every pipeline it ships with `precompilePipeline`, which is where the first variant
 * comes from.
 *
 * The whole `RenderPipeline` C struct is assembled inside one confined [Arena]; the struct writes
 * use the named offsets from [WmNative] so the ABI mapping can be checked against `bindings.h`
 * line by line.
 *
 * Note: 26.1 removed the per-pipeline colour target *format* (only blend state remains in
 * `ColorTargetState`) and the main render target is always `RGBA8`, which is what is declared
 * here. A pipeline that ever needs another target format would change [MAIN_TARGET_FORMAT].
